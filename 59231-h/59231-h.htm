<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>Robert Curthose, eldest son of William the Conqueror, had
been dead but a few years when Abbot Suger set about rebuilding
the great abbey church of Saint-Denis, which was dedicated with
such pomp and ceremony in 1144. Among the scenes from the
First Crusade which filled one of its famous stained-glass windows,
there was one which portrayed Robert, mounted upon his
charger, in the act of overthrowing a pagan warrior—“Robertus
dux Normannorum Partum prosternit,” ran the inscription beneath
it.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> It was thus, as a hero of the Crusade, that the great
Abbot Suger chose to recall him, and it was as such that his fame
survived in after times. Robert was not a masterful character,
and it cannot be said that as a ruler he made a deep impression
upon his generation. Overshadowed by his great father, cheated
of a kingdom by his more aggressive brothers, and finally defeated
in battle, deprived of his duchy, and condemned to perpetual
imprisonment, his misdirected life offers a melancholy
contrast to the more brilliant careers of the abler members of his
family. Yet, if he was himself lacking in greatness, he was closely
associated with great names and great events; and his unmeasured
generosity and irrepressible bonhomie gained him many
friends in his lifetime, and made him a personality which is not
without its attractions to the modern. It is hoped that a study of
his career which attempts to set him in his true relation to the
history of Normandy and England and of the Crusade may be of
interest not only to the specialist but to the general reader.</p>

<p>It is now more than a generation since Gaston Le Hardy published
<i>Le dernier des ducs normands: étude de critique historique
sur Robert Courte-Heuse</i> (1882), the only monograph upon Robert
which has hitherto appeared. In spite of its age, if this were the
critical study which its title implies, the present essay need hardly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
have been undertaken. But it makes no use of documentary materials,
and is unfortunately a work of violent <i>parti pris</i>, quite
lacking in criticism according to modern standards. “J’ ai entrepris,”
says the author in his preface, “à l’aide de quelques autres
chroniqueurs, une lutte contre notre vieil Orderic Vital, essayant
de lui arracher par lambeaux la vérité vraie sur un personnage
dont il ne nous a donné que la caricature.” It may be granted
that Ordericus Vitalis was a hostile critic, who sometimes did
Robert scanty justice; but assuredly there is no occasion for
polemics or for an <i>apologia</i> such as Le Hardy has given us, and I
have no intention of following in his footsteps. My purpose is a
more modest one, namely to set forth a full and true account of
the life and character of Robert Curthose upon the basis of an
independent and critical examination of all the sources. To any
one acquainted with the state of the materials on which the investigator
must perforce depend for any study of the late eleventh
and early twelfth centuries, it will not be surprising that there
are many gaps in our information concerning Robert’s life and
many problems which must remain unsolved. I have tried at all
times to make my own researches and to draw my own conclusions
directly from the sources when the evidence permitted, and to
refrain from drawing conclusions when it seemed inadequate.
But my indebtedness to the secondary writers who have preceded
me in the field is abundantly apparent in the index and in the
footnotes, where full acknowledgments are made. The works of
E. A. Freeman upon the Norman Conquest and upon the reign of
William Rufus have proved especially helpful for Robert’s life as
a whole, as have also various more recent monographs which bear
upon his career at certain points. Among these are the works of
Louis Halphen upon the county of Anjou, of Robert Latouche
upon Maine, and of Augustin Fliche upon the reign of Philip I of
France. For the chapter on the Crusade much use has been made
of the detailed chronology of Heinrich Hagenmeyer and of the
exhaustive notes in his well known editions of the sources for the
First Crusade, as well as of the admirable monograph by Ferdinand
Chalandon upon the reign of the Emperor Alexius I. The
appendix <i>De Iniusta Vexatione Willelmi Episcopi Primi</i> has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
already been published in the <i>English Historical Review</i>, and is
here reproduced by the kind permission of the editor.</p>

<p>It is more than a pleasure to acknowledge my obligations to
those whose counsel and assistance have been constantly at my
disposal in the preparation of this volume. By the librarians and
their staffs in the libraries of Harvard University, the University
of California, the University of Pennsylvania, and Bryn Mawr
College I have been treated with a courtesy and helpfulness which
are beyond praise. Mr. George W. Robinson, Secretary of the
Graduate School of Arts and Sciences of Harvard University, has
given me much valuable assistance in preparing the manuscript
for the press and in the correction of the proof. Finally, I have to
acknowledge a debt of gratitude which is deeper than can well be
expressed in writing, that which I owe to my teachers. It was
Professor Dana C. Munro, now of Princeton University, who first
taught me to care greatly for the Middle Ages and awakened my
interest in the Crusades. He has followed this volume with
kindly interest while it has been in the making, and has given me
much helpful criticism upon that part which relates to the First
Crusade. But above all I am indebted to Professor Charles H.
Haskins of Harvard University, at whose suggestion this work
was first undertaken and without whose help and counsel it could
hardly have been brought to completion. While the author must
accept full responsibility for the statements and conclusions
herein contained, it is proper to say that the documentary materials
which Professor Haskins had collected, as well as the
results of his own researches, were placed at my disposal in manuscript
before their publication in his recent volume entitled
<i>Norman Institutions</i>, that separate chapters as they have been
prepared have passed through his hands for detailed criticism,
and that his unfailing patience has extended even to the reading
of the proof sheets.</p>

<h1>ROBERT CURTHOSE</h1>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="smaller">YOUTH</span></h2>

<p>William of Malmesbury, in his well known sketch of the life
and character of Robert Curthose,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> relates an interesting episode.
He tells us that Robert, in the heat of youth, and spurred on by
the fatuous counsels of his companions, went to his father, William
the Conqueror, and demanded that the rule of Normandy be
forthwith given over into his hands. William not only refused the
rash request, but drove the lad away with the thunders of his
terrific voice; whereupon Robert withdrew in a rage and began to
pillage the countryside. At first the Conqueror was only convulsed
with laughter at these youthful escapades, and said, emphasizing
his words with a favorite oath: “By the resurrection
of God! This little Robert Curthose will be a brave fellow.”<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Robert Curthose or ‘Short-Boots’ (<i>Curta Ocrea</i>), this was the
curious nickname which his father had given him on account of
his diminutive stature.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The name seemed appropriate and was
taken up by the people. In time, however, William of Malmesbury
goes on to explain, Robert’s acts of insubordination became
far more serious, and ended by provoking the Conqueror to a
truly Norman burst of wrath, a curse, and disinheritance.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> But
all this is a matter which must be deferred for later consideration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>Whether the episode just recounted be fact or legend,<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> the
chronicler in his hurried sketch has, in any event, drawn the picture
of an undutiful, graceless son, often harassing his father with
wild acts of insubordination. This, too, is the impression which
is to be gathered from a cursory reading of Ordericus Vitalis, by
far the most voluminous contemporary writer upon the life and
character of Robert Curthose, and it is the impression which has
been preserved in the histories of later times.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> A more careful
reading of the sources may, however, lead to a somewhat different
view of the character of the Norman duke who forms the subject
of the present essay. It must be owned at the outset, however,
that the sources, especially for Robert’s youth, are exceedingly
meagre and fragmentary, and only a few details can be pieced
together.</p>

<p>The date of Robert’s birth is nowhere stated by contemporary
writers. We know that he was the firstborn child of William the
Bastard, duke of Normandy, and of his wife Matilda, daughter of
Count Baldwin V of Flanders.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> But the date of the marriage of
William and Matilda is also a matter of much uncertainty. It
has been generally assigned by modern writers, but without any
early authority, to the year 1053.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> It certainly took place after
October 1049, for in that year we find Pope Leo IX and the council<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
of Rheims forbidding it as an act then in contemplation.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> It
certainly had been performed in defiance of ecclesiastical authority
by 1053, the year in which Countess Matilda first appears
beside her husband among the witnesses of extant legal documents.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
So, too, Robert’s birth has been assigned by modern
writers to <i>circa</i> 1054,<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> but this again is conjectural and rests upon
no early authority. Our knowledge of Robert’s later career makes
it seem improbable that he was born later than 1054 and suggests
the possibility that he may have been born a little earlier.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>Though the evidence is meagre and fragmentary, it is clear that
William and Matilda were by no means careless about the education
of their eldest son and prospective heir. In an early charter
we meet with a certain “Raherius consiliarius infantis” and a
“Tetboldus gramaticus.”<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> And among the witnesses of a charter
by the youthful Robert himself—the earliest that we have of
his—dated at Rouen in 1066, appears one “Hilgerius pedagogus
Roberti filii comitis.”<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Not improbably this is the same Ilger
who, in April of the following year, attested a charter by William
the Conqueror at Vaudreuil.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Robert, therefore, had tutors, or
‘counsellors’, who were charged with his education, and who
formed part of the ducal entourage and made their way into the
documents of the period.</p>

<p>That these educational efforts were not wholly vain, there is
some reason to believe. Robert has not, like his youngest
brother, Henry, received the flattering title of Beauclerc, and
there is no direct evidence that he knew Latin. Yet some notable
accomplishments he did have. Not to mention his affable manners,
he was famed for his fluency of speech, or ‘eloquence’,
especially in his native tongue.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> And if towards the close of his
unfortunate life he became the author, as has been supposed, of
an extant poem in the Welsh language,<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> it may perhaps be allowed
that in his youth he had acquired at least a taste and
capacity for things literary.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>The hopes of William and Matilda were early centred upon
their oldest son, and his initiation into the politics of his ambitious
father was not long delayed. As the result of a revolution
at Le Mans, the youthful Count Herbert II with his mother and
his sister Margaret had been driven into exile, and the direct
rule of Geoffrey Martel, count of Anjou, had been established in
Maine.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> William of Normandy, ever jealous of Angevin expansion,
was not slow to realize what his policy should be in the
light of these events. By giving support to the exiles he might
hope to curb the ambition of Geoffrey Martel and to extend
Norman influence, conceivably Norman domination, over Maine.
Accordingly, at an undetermined date between 1055 and 1060—probably
between 1058 and 1060<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>—he entered into a treaty of
far-reaching significance with the exiled count. Herbert formally
became Duke William’s vassal for the county of Maine, and
agreed that, if he should die childless, the duke should succeed him
in all his rights and possessions. And further, a double marriage
alliance was arranged, according to which William promised the
count one of his infant daughters, and Robert Curthose was
affianced to Herbert’s sister, Margaret of Maine.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Thus Robert,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
while still a mere child, was made a pawn in the ambitious game
which his father was playing for the possession of a coveted
county. Margaret, too, was young; but the duke brought her to
Normandy, and, placing her in the ward of Stigand de Mézidon,
made due provision for her honorable rearing until the children
should arrive at an age suitable for marriage.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, fortune set strongly in Duke William’s favor in
Maine. Charters indicate that Herbert had made at least a
partial recovery of his authority in the county<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>—through the
assistance, it may be presumed, of his powerful Norman overlord.
On 9 March 1062<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Count Herbert died childless, and under the
terms of the recent treaty the county should have passed immediately
into the hands of Duke William. But the Manceaux,
or at least an Angevin or anti-Norman party among them, had
no disposition to submit themselves to the ‘Norman yoke’; and
within a year after Count Herbert’s death they rose in revolt.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
They chose as Count Herbert’s successor Walter of Mantes, count
of the Vexin, a bitter enemy of the Normans, who had a claim
upon Maine through his wife Biota, a daughter of Herbert Éveille-Chien.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
They also obtained the aid of Geoffrey le Barbu, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
had succeeded to the county of Anjou upon the death of Geoffrey
Martel in 1060.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Thus they were able to offer formidable opposition
to Norman aggression. But Duke William was determined
not to let slip so good an opportunity of extending his dominion
over Maine, and he took up the challenge with his accustomed
vigor. A single campaign sufficed to accomplish his purpose.
Walter of the Vexin and Biota, his wife, were taken and imprisoned
at Falaise; and soon after they died—it is reported, as the
result of poisoning.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> The Manceaux were quickly defeated and
reduced to submission, and Duke William entered Le Mans in
triumph.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>With Geoffrey le Barbu, however, William decided to make
terms. The provisions of the treaty which was concluded between
them have not been preserved; but, in any case, it is clear
that Duke William recognized the Angevin suzerainty over
Maine.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Doubtless this seemed to him the most effective way of
consolidating his conquest and throwing over it the mantle of
legality by which he always set such great store.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> At a formal
ceremony in the duke’s presence at Alençon, Robert Curthose and
Margaret of Maine, his fiancée, were made to do homage and
swear fealty to Geoffrey le Barbu for the inheritance of Count
Herbert.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>This feudal ceremony at Alençon gave formal legal sanction to
Robert’s position as count of Maine. Yet he was still a mere
child, and Duke William clearly had no intention of actually
setting him to rule the newly acquired territory. He could have
had no hand in the warfare by which it had been won, and to impose
a foreign yoke upon the Manceaux in the face of the ardent
spirit of local patriotism was a task for stronger hands than his.
Robert’s countship, for the time being at any rate, remained a
purely formal one, and Duke William with the assistance of Norman
administrators and a Norman garrison kept the government
of the county in his own hands.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Nevertheless, the new legal
status to which the young prince had been raised found at least
occasional recognition in the documents of the period. In several
early charters we meet with his attestation as count of Maine,<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
and one document of the year 1076 indicates that at that time he
was regarded as an independent ruler of the county.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, if he had grown to feel any affection for his prospective
bride, the beautiful Countess Margaret,<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> his hopes were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
doomed to early disappointment; for, before either of the children
had reached a marriageable age, Margaret died at Fécamp, and
was buried there in the monastery of La Trinité.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> This, however,
did not mean that the Norman plans with regard to Maine
had seriously miscarried. Duke William continued to maintain
his hold upon the county; and Robert continued to be called
count<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> and to be designated as his father’s heir and successor
in the government.</p>

<p>Indeed, the assigning of the countship of Maine to Robert was
but part of a general plan which embraced all of Duke William’s
dominions, and under which Robert was early marked out as his
successor designate for the whole. In a charter of 29 June 1063—contemporary,
therefore, with the Norman conquest of
Maine<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>—the young prince appears after his parents with the
following significant designation: “Roberti, eorum filii, quem
elegerant ad gubernandum regnum post suum obitum.”<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Clearly
at this early date Robert had already been definitely chosen as the
successor to his father’s rule.</p>

<p>With Duke William still in the prime vigor of manhood, and
menaced by no particular dangers, such a provision seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
have no great immediate importance. But with the death of
Edward the Confessor and the inception of the ambitious plan for
the Norman conquest of England, Duke William’s future took on
a far more uncertain aspect. Great and careful though the preparations
were, almost anything might happen in such an enterprise.
It was a grave moment for men with Norman interests as
the duke stood upon the threshold of his great adventure. The
prudent abbot of Marmoutier hastened to obtain from the youthful
Robert a confirmation of all the gifts which his father had
made to the abbey.<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Duke William, too, felt the uncertainties of
the hour and made careful provision against all eventualities.
Summoning the great nobles around him, he solemnly proclaimed
Robert his heir and successor, and had the barons do homage and
swear fealty to him as their lord.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Unless the sources are misleading,
King Philip of France, Duke William’s overlord, was
present and gave his consent to the action.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>Robert, however, was evidently still too young and inexperienced
to be entrusted with the actual administration of the
duchy at such a critical moment; and the government during the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
duke’s absence on the Conquest was placed in the hands of
Countess Matilda and a council of regents.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> But when in December
1067, after the successful launching of his great enterprise,
the Conqueror found it necessary to go a second time to England,
Robert was called to higher honors and responsibilities, and was
definitely associated with his mother in the regency.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> From this
same year he begins to appear in occasional charters as ‘count of
the Normans’;<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> and when in the following year Matilda was
called to England for her coronation, there is some reason to
believe that he was charged with full responsibility for the
administration of Normandy.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>Whether this implied a like responsibility for the government
of Maine is not clear. If it did, Robert certainly proved unequal
to the task of maintaining Norman dominion in that turbulent
county. Norman rule had from the beginning been unpopular in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Maine. The citizens of Le Mans were alert and rebellious, and
Duke William’s preoccupation with the conquest of England
offered them a unique opportunity to strike a blow for independence.
Accordingly, in 1069, they rose in revolt<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> and overthrew
the Norman domination more quickly even than it had been
established by Duke William in 1063. During the following three
years Maine passed through a turbulent era, which—interesting
as it is for both local and general history—hardly concerns the
life of Robert Curthose; since, so far as can be discovered, no
effort was made during that period to reëstablish Norman authority
in the county. The collapse of the Norman rule had been
as complete as it was sudden.</p>

<p>By the spring of 1073, however, King William had returned to
the Continent and was in a position to turn his attention to the
reconquest of Maine. Assembling a great army composed of both
Normans and English, he marched into the county, reduced
Fresnay, Beaumont, and Sillé in quick succession, and arrived
before Le Mans, which surrendered without a siege.<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> The
authority of the Conqueror, perhaps we may even say the
authority of Robert Curthose,<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> was fully reëstablished. The
sources are silent as to the part which Robert played in these
events or in the struggles of the succeeding years by which the
Conqueror maintained the Norman domination in the face of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
jealous opposition of Fulk le Réchin, count of Anjou.<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> Robert
certainly continued to enjoy the formal dignity of count of
Maine.<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> Indeed, a charter of 25 August 1076 seems to indicate
that he was at that time regarded as an independent ruler at Le
Mans.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Conqueror took occasion to reaffirm his intentions
regarding the succession to his dominions. At some time
after the conquest of England but before the outbreak of his unfortunate
quarrels with his eldest son, he fell dangerously sick at
Bonneville; and, fearing for his life, he summoned the barons
around him, as he had done previously upon the eve of the Norman
Conquest, and had them renew their homage and pledge of
fealty to Robert as their lord.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> Again Robert Curthose was
formally designated as the heir of all his father’s dominions.</p>

<p>If, therefore, one looks back upon Robert’s life from about the
year 1077, far from feeling surprise at the slowness of his development
or at the lateness of his initiation into political and government
affairs, one must rather wonder at the early age at which he
became a pawn in the great game of politics, war, and diplomacy
which his father was playing so shrewdly, and at the rapidity with
which at least minor responsibilities were thrust upon him. Affianced
to the prospective heiress of the county of Maine when
little more than an infant, he was designated as his father’s heir
and successor while still a mere child, and began to give his formal
attestation to legal documents at about the same period. At the
age of twelve, or thereabouts, he received the homage of the Norman
barons as their lord and prospective ruler, and soon after
was associated with his mother in the regency during the king’s
absence from the duchy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>Down to the year 1077, there is no evidence of quarrels or disagreement
between the Conqueror and his eldest son.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> Indeed,
the proof seems almost conclusive that there were no such quarrels
until a relatively late date. Not only do the narrative sources
upon careful analysis yield no evidence of disobedience or rebellion
upon Robert’s part, but positive documentary evidence
points strongly in the opposite direction. A series of charters
scattered from 1063 to 1077 reveals Robert on repeated occasions
in close association with his parents and his brothers, occupying
an honored position, and attesting legal acts<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> almost as frequently
as the queen, more frequently than his brothers. That
the family harmony was not disturbed by domestic discord as
late as the autumn of 1077 there is good reason to believe. For,
in that year, Robert joined with his parents and his younger
brother William in the imposing dedication ceremonies of Bishop
Odo’s great cathedral church at Bayeux,<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> and again, 13 September,
in the dedication of the abbey church of the Conqueror’s
foundation in honor of St. Stephen at Caen.<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

these charters are dated 1053, and the attestations of Matilda seem incontestably
contemporary. The Tours charter in addition to the incarnation has “regnante

clearly refers to the year 1053. No. 26 of the same collection similarly gives 1059
as the thirty-fourth year of King Henry. Both evidently reckon the reign as beginning

for even though the marriage had taken place as early as 1049, it would clearly be
impossible for Robert to attest a document in 1051. Lot explains, “Les souscriptions

bishop of Le Mans, 31 August 1055, and earlier than the death of Geoffrey Martel,

two sources are not in complete accord. Except at one point I have preferred the
former as being the more strictly contemporary. William of Poitiers represents the
betrothal of William and Margaret not as a part of the original treaty, but as a
later arrangement made by Duke William after Herbert’s death in order to forestall
a possible controversy as to Norman rights in Maine. But this marriage alliance
looms so large in the narrative of Ordericus Vitalis that it seems hardly likely that
it was a mere afterthought on Duke William’s part. Ordericus represents it as the
fundamental provision of the treaty. According to his view it was through Margaret
that Norman rights in Maine arose. He does not seem to realize that upon such
reasoning they would also terminate with her death. For William of Poitiers, on
the other hand, the fundamental provision of the treaty was the agreement that
Duke William should be Count Herbert’s heir. This would give the duke permanent
rights after Herbert’s death. It seems not unlikely that both provisions were
included in the treaty and that Duke William regarded them both as important.
At times he dealt with Maine as if of his own absolute right; at other times he put
forward his son as bearer of the Norman rights.</p>

of the counts of Maine, and forms no part of his general narrative of William’s conquest
of the county in 1063. The date of the homage, therefore, is conjectural.
The revolt of the Manceaux took place soon after the death of Count Herbert;
and since Geoffrey le Barbu supported the revolt, it seems natural to regard the
homage as a final act in the general pacification, and to assign it to 1063. This is
the view taken by Latouche (<i>Maine</i>, p. 35) as against Kate Norgate (<i>England

Margaret died 13 December 1060; but this is clearly an error, since after the death
of Count Herbert II (9 March 1062) she joined with Robert Curthose in doing
homage to Geoffrey le Barbu, and this act took place apparently in the year 1063.
Ordericus, ii, p. 253; and cf. <i>supra</i>, n. 32. Latouche suggests that the editors of

and are in error, therefore, only as to the year. <i>Maine</i>, p. 32, n. 6. It is probably
only a desire for literary effect which leads William of Poitiers to say that Margaret
was snatched away by death shortly before her proposed marriage: “Sed ipsam
non longe ante diem quo mortali sponso iungeretur hominibus abstulit Virginis
Filius.” Apparently at the time of her death Margaret had become a nun. Robert
of Torigny states that she died a ‘virgo Christo devota’, and William of Poitiers
says that she died practising great austerities and wearing a hair shirt.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_43" id="Footnote_43"></a><a href="#FNanchor_43"><span class="label">[42]</span></a> The date of the ceremony is uncertain. It can hardly have been as early as
the charter of 1063 which is cited in n. 40 <i>supra.</i> It seems more likely to have been
a measure taken in 1066 when the attack upon England was in contemplation.
Thus Ordericus Vitalis (ii, p. 294) speaks of it somewhat vaguely as a measure
taken “ante Senlacium,” and in another place (ii, p. 378) he makes Robert say to
his father: “Normanniam … quam dudum, antequam contra Heraldum in
Angliam transfretares, mihi concessisti”; and again (iii, p. 242) he makes the Conqueror
on his deathbed use language of similar import: “Ducatum Normanniae,
antequam in epitumo Senlac contra Heraldum certassem, Roberto filio meo concessi,
quia primogenitus est. Hominium pene omnium huius patriae baronum iam
recepit.” Florence of Worcester, <i>Chronicon ex Chronicis</i>, ed. Benjamin Thorpe
(London, 1848-49), ii, p. 12: “Normanniam quam sibi ante adventum ipsius in
Angliam, coram Philippo rege Francorum dederat.” Cf. <i>A.-S. C.</i>, <i>a.</i> 1079; <i>Interpolations

<p><a name="Footnote_44" id="Footnote_44"></a><a href="#FNanchor_44"><span class="label">[43]</span></a> The question as to the period and manner of this homage is complicated by
the fact that the ceremony was repeated at an undetermined date after the Norman
Conquest on the occasion of the king’s serious illness at Bonneville. The <i>Anglo-Saxon
Chronicle</i> (<i>a.</i> 1079) and Florence of Worcester (ii, p. 12) are the only sources
which mention the assent of King Philip. From Florence it seems to be clear that
this assent was given on the earlier occasion.</p>

of Troarn (<i>ibid.</i>, no. 172). Lot publishes two charters of 1051, in which Robert’s
attestation as the ‘young count’ has been interpolated at some later date. See
<i>supra</i>, n. 10. He also publishes a charter, “vers 1071,” in which appears “presente

<p>There is no regular practice with regard to Robert’s title in documents during
the Conqueror’s lifetime. Occasionally, as above noted, he is called ‘count of the
Normans’; occasionally, as has been pointed out in an earlier note (<i>supra</i>, n. 34),
he bears the title ‘count of Maine.’ Often he appears without title as ‘Robert the
king’s son’ (Davis, <i>Regesta</i>, nos. 73, 92a, 126, 140, 165, 168, 171, 255); but generally

frequently his designation is ‘Count Robert the king’s son’ (<i>ibid.</i>, nos. 30, 74, 75,

<p>Down to the year 1077 the conduct of Robert Curthose towards
the king had, so far as we can see, been exemplary. Even William
of Malmesbury, while criticising his later insubordination, still
pays tribute to his obedient youth.<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> But difficulties were now at
hand. Robert was rapidly growing to manhood, and his character
was unfolding. Reared among his father’s men-at-arms, residing
much about the court, enjoying the privileged position and the
social freedom of the king’s heir and successor designate, he had
developed into a warrior of distinguished valor,<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and into a chivalrous
knight and courtier considerably in advance of the rude
society of the eleventh century.<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Short and thick-set, though
probably the coarse full face and enormous paunch<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> of later
years had not yet developed; fluent of speech, affable in bearing,
and of a jovial disposition; generous to the point of prodigality,
giving to all who asked with unstinting hand, and lavish of
promises when more substantial rewards were lacking;<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
become the centre of interest and attraction for the younger set
about the Norman court, and from some points of view a serious
rival of his father. His position was not unlike that of Henry Fitz
Henry, the ‘Young King,’ who nearly a century later created
such grave problems for Henry II. He had long borne the title of
count and had enjoyed an official, or semi-official, position about
the court. He had long since been formally recognized as his
father’s heir and successor. The barons had twice done him
homage and sworn fealty to him as their lord and future master.
He was titular ruler of Maine. And if, as two charters seem to
indicate, he was in some way formally invested with the Norman
duchy in 1077 or 1078,<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> the resemblance between his position
and that of the Young King after his coronation in 1170 is even
more striking.</p>

<p>Yet, with all these honors, Robert enjoyed no real power and
exercised no active part in affairs of government. It was not the
way of the Conqueror to part with any of his prerogatives prematurely;
and if, for reasons of state, he bestowed formal honors
upon his son, it was still his firm intention to remain sole master
until the last within his own dominions. But for the young prince
to continue thus in idleness, surrounded by a crowd of restless
hangers-on of the younger nobility, was both costly and dangerous.
Robert not unnaturally wished for an independent establishment
and an income of his own;<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> but these the king was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
unwilling to provide. Robert, therefore, became dissatisfied; and
the ambitious companions by whom he was surrounded were not
slow to fan the embers of his growing discontent.<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Apparently
it was in the year 1078, or late in 1077,<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> that the unfortunate
quarrel broke out which culminated in the siege of Gerberoy and
a personal encounter between father and son upon the field of
battle.</p>

<p>Upon the cause of the disagreement we are fortunate in having
abundant testimony,<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and it is possible to define the issue with
some exactness. Prompted by the rash counsels of his time-serving
companions, Robert went to the king and demanded that
immediate charge of the government of Normandy and of Maine
be committed forthwith into his hands. To Maine he based his
claim upon his rights through Margaret, his deceased fiancée, to
Normandy upon the twice repeated grant which his father had
made to him, once before the Conquest, and afterwards at Bonneville,
when the assembled barons had done him homage and
pledged their fealty to him as their lord.<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>If reliance may be placed upon the account of Ordericus
Vitalis,<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> the Conqueror took some time to reflect upon his son’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
demands and endeavored to reason with him about them.<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> He
urged Robert to put away the rash young men who had prompted
him to such imprudence and to give ear to wiser counsels. He
explained that his demands were improper. He, the king, held
Normandy by hereditary right, and England by right of conquest;
and it would be preposterous to expect him to give them
up to another. If Robert would only be patient and show himself
worthy, he would receive all in due course, with the willing assent
of the people and with the blessing of God. Let him remember
Absalom and what happened to him, and beware lest he follow in
the path of Rehoboam! But to all these weighty arguments
Robert turned a deaf ear, replying that he had not come to hear
sermons: he had heard such “ad nauseam” from the grammarians.
His determination was immovably fixed. He would no
longer do service to anyone in Normandy in the mean condition
of a dependent. The king’s resolution, however, was equally
firm. Normandy, he declared, was his native land, and he wished
all to understand that so long as he lived he would never let it slip
from his grasp.<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> The argument thus came to a deadlock; yet,
apparently, there was no immediate break.<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Relations doubtless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
continued strained, but Robert bided his time, perhaps seeking a
more favorable opportunity for pressing his demands. At times
he may even have appeared reconciled; yet no lasting settlement
was possible so long as the cause of the discord remained.</p>

<p>The actual outbreak of open rebellion followed, it seems,
directly upon a family broil among the king’s sons; and Ordericus
Vitalis, with characteristic fondness for gossip, has not failed to
relate the incident in great detail.<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> The Conqueror, so the story
runs, was preparing an expedition against the Corbonnais and
had stopped at Laigle in the house of a certain Gontier, while
Robert Curthose had found lodgings nearby in the house of Roger
of Caux. Meanwhile, Robert’s younger brothers, William and
Henry, had taken umbrage at his pretensions and at the rash
demands which he had made upon their father, and they were
strongly supporting the king against him. While in this frame
of mind they paid Robert a visit at his lodgings. Going into an
upper room, they began dicing ‘as soldiers will’; and presently—doubtless
after there had been drinking—they started a row
and threw down water upon their host and his companions who
were on the floor below. Robert was not unnaturally enraged at
this insult, and with the support of his comrades<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> he rushed in
upon the offenders, and a wild scuffle ensued, which was only
terminated by the timely arrival of the king, who, upon hearing
the clamor, came in haste from his lodgings and put a stop to the
quarrel by his royal presence.<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>Robert, however, remained sullen and offended; and that
night, accompanied by his intimates, he withdrew secretly from
the royal forces and departed. Riding straight for Rouen, he
made the rash venture of attempting to seize the castle by a surprise
attack, an action which seems almost incredible, except on
the hypothesis that a conspiracy with wide ramifications was
already under way. However this may be, the attack upon Rouen
failed. Roger of Ivry, the king’s butler, who was guarding the
castle, got word of the impending stroke, set the defences in order,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
and sent messengers in hot haste to warn the king of the danger.
William was furious at his son’s treason, and ordered a wholesale
arrest of the malcontents, thus spreading consternation among
them and breaking up their plans. Some were captured, but
others escaped across the frontier.<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>The rising now spread rapidly among the king’s enemies on
both sides of the border. Hugh of Châteauneuf-en-Thymerais
promptly opened the gates of his castles at Châteauneuf, Sorel,
and Rémalard to the fugitives, and so furnished them with a
secure base beyond the frontier from which to make incursions
into Normandy. Robert of Bellême also joined the rebel cause.
Perhaps, indeed, it was through his influence that Hugh of
Châteauneuf was persuaded to give succor to the rebels; for Hugh
was his brother-in-law, having married his sister Mabel. Ralph
de Toeny, lord of Conches, also joined the rebellion, and many
others, among them doubtless being Ivo and Alberic of Grandmesnil
and Aimeric de Villeray.<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> The border war which followed
did not long remain a local matter. It was an event fit to bring
joy to all King William’s enemies; and it caused a great commotion,
we are told, not only in the immediate neighborhood of the
revolt, but also in distant parts among the French and Bretons
and the men of Maine and Anjou.<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>The king, however, met the rebellion with his accustomed
vigor and decision. He confiscated the lands of the rebels and
turned their rents to the employment of mercenaries to be used
against them. Apparently he had been on his way to make war
upon Rotrou of Mortagne in the Corbonnais when his plans had
been interrupted by the disgraceful brawl among his sons at
Laigle.<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> He now abandoned that enterprise, and, making peace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
with Rotrou, took him and his troops into his own service. And
thus raising a considerable army, he laid siege to the rebels in
their stronghold at Rémalard.<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> But of the outcome of these
operations we have no certain knowledge. One of the insurgents
at least, Aimeric de Villeray, was slain, and his son Gulfer was so
terrified by his father’s tragic fate that he made peace with the
king and remained thereafter unshakably loyal.</p>

<p>We hear, too, vaguely of a ‘dapifer’ of the king of France who
was passing from castle to castle among the rebels.<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> What his
business was we know not; but it seems not unlikely that King
Philip was already negotiating with the insurgent leaders with a
view to aiding and abetting their enterprise against his too powerful
Norman vassal.<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Philip had made peace with the Conqueror
after the latter’s unsuccessful siege of Dol in 1076,<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> but the
friendship of the two kings had not been lasting. Sound policy
demanded that Philip spare no effort to curb the overweening
power of his great Norman feudatory; and William had, therefore,
to count upon his constant, if veiled, hostility.<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> The
rebellion of Robert Curthose and his followers was Philip’s opportunity;
and it seems not improbable that he looked upon the
movement with favor and gave it encouragement from its inception.
Clearly he made no effort to suppress it, though the fighting
was going on within his own borders. And, in any case, before the
end of 1078 he had definitely taken Robert Curthose under his
protection and had assigned him the castle of Gerberoy in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Beauvaisis, close to the Norman frontier.<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> There Robert was
received with his followers by royal castellans and promised every
possible aid and support.</p>

<p>But this evidently was some months, at least, after the outbreak
of Robert’s rebellion. As to his movements in the meantime,
we hear little more than uncertain rumors. The sources are
silent concerning the part which he played in the border warfare
which centred around the castles of Hugh of Châteauneuf. We
have it on the express statement of the <i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i>
that Robert fled to his uncle, Robert the Frisian, count of Flanders;<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
and in this the <i>Chronicle</i> is confirmed by Ordericus Vitalis,
who adds that he also visited Odo, bishop of Treves.<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Other
writers indicate simply that he withdrew into France.<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> Ordericus
indeed, represents him as wandering much farther, and visiting
noble kinsmen, “dukes, counts, and powerful townsmen (<i>oppidani</i>)
in Lorraine, Germany, Aquitaine, and Gascony,” wasting
his substance in dissolute living and reduced to poverty and beggary,
and to borrowing of foreign usurers.<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> But such wanderings,
if they actually occurred, it seems more natural to assign—since
we are reduced to conjecture—to Robert’s second exile.<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> One
incident, however, which concerns his mother, the queen, who
died in 1083, must be assigned to this period.</p>

<p>The singularly happy relations which existed between William
and Matilda, their mutual love, devotion, and confidence, are of
course famous. Once only during their long union were these
happy relations seriously disturbed.<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> For Matilda’s heart was
touched by the distresses of her son, and she did not sympathize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
with the stern justice of the Conqueror in this domestic matter.
Secretly she undertook to provide Robert out of her own revenues
with funds for the maintenance of a military force. But the king
soon detected her and interfered, declaring, in his wrath, that he
had learned the truth of the adage, “A faithless woman is her
husband’s bane.” He had loved her as his own soul and had intrusted
her with his treasures and with jurisdiction throughout
all his dominions, only to find her giving succor to enemies who
were plotting against his life. But undaunted by this outburst,
the queen sought to justify herself upon the ground of her great
love for her eldest son. Though Robert were dead and buried
seven feet under the earth, she declared, she would gladly die, if
by so doing she could restore him to life. Respecting the spirit of
his proud consort, the king turned to vent his rage upon Samson
le Breton, the queen’s messenger, proposing to seize him and have
him blinded. But Samson received timely warning and managed
to escape to Saint-Évroul; and, at the queen’s request, Abbot
Mainer received him into the monastery. There he dwelt in
security and led an exemplary life for twenty-six years, no doubt
well known to the chronicler of the house who records his tale.<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>Whatever be the truth about Robert’s wanderings and the
vicissitudes of his exile, in the end he returned to France and, as
already noted, gained the support of King Philip, and was established
with his followers in the castle of Gerberoy in the Beauvaisis.
There a military force of considerable proportions began
to gather around him in response to his lavish promises. Adventurers
came from France; but in greater numbers came the malcontents
from Normandy. Many who hitherto had kept the
peace and had remained loyal to the king now deserted the royal
cause and went over to swell the ranks of the rebels.<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> King
William was now obliged to turn his attention to this hornet’s
nest that was spreading terror among the peaceful and defenceless
population on his northeastern frontier. Quartering troops
in his strongholds opposite Gerberoy, he endeavored to forestall
the destructive raids which the insurgents were making into his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
territory.<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> But, vexed that his enemies should seem to dwell in
security at a point so little removed from the borders of Normandy,
he determined to carry the war beyond the frontier; and,
though it was the inclement season, he assembled his forces and
laid siege to Gerberoy itself for some three weeks soon after
Christmas (1078-79).<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>The operations which followed were enlivened in the fashion of
the day by the frequent interchange of challenges and by numerous
encounters between selected bodies of knights from each
side,<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> until finally the besieged garrison brought the contest to an
issue by a successful sortie and a pitched battle in the open before
the castle.<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> In the general mêlée which ensued the Conqueror
and Robert met in single combat, and the elderly king proved no
match for his vigorous and skilful antagonist. He was wounded
in the hand or arm, and his horse was shot from under him.<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
According to one, and perhaps the better, account, Tokig son of
Wigod, a faithful Englishman, hurried to the king with another
mount, only to be himself slain a moment later by a shaft from a
crossbow.<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> According to another account, however, at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
supreme moment of his antagonist’s distress, Robert recognized
his father’s voice—armor had hitherto disguised the king—and,
leaping down from his own horse, he directed him to mount and
allowed him to ride away.<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Many of the king’s men were slain,
others were captured, and many more were wounded, among
them being Robert’s younger brother, William Rufus.<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> The discomfiture
of the royal forces was complete, and they fled from the
field.<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>This unexpected defeat before the walls of Gerberoy was a
deep humiliation to the Conqueror. William of Malmesbury
speaks of it as the one outstanding misfortune of his long and
brilliant career.<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> In the bitterness of his shame and of his indignation
against the son who had not only rebelled against him, but
had actually met him on the field of battle and wounded and
unhorsed him, William is said to have laid on Robert a terrible
curse, vowing to disinherit him forever.<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> Though the curse was
soon lifted and grudging forgiveness granted, one might easily
believe from the misfortunes of Robert’s later years that the baneful
influence of this paternal malediction followed him to his
grave more than half a century later beneath the pavement
stones of Gloucester abbey.</p>

<p>The part played by the king of France in the border war
around Gerberoy is puzzling. The narrative sources state specifically
that King Philip had given his support to Robert and the
Norman rebels and had deliberately established them at Gerberoy
in order that they might harry the Norman border. Yet
we have a charter of unquestioned validity by King Philip in favor
of the church of Saint-Quentin of Beauvais, which bears the
signatures of both William and Philip and a dating clause which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
reveals the fact that it was drawn up at the siege which the two
kings were conducting about Gerberoy in 1079.<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> The evidence
is conclusive, therefore, that, though the French king had previously
supported Robert and had actually established him at
Gerberoy, he nevertheless joined with the Conqueror early in
1079 in besieging the Norman rebels in his own stronghold.<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
How King William had wrought this change of mind in his jealous
overlord we have no means of knowing. But it is evident that,
while meeting his son’s rebellion by force of arms, he had not
been forgetful of his mastery of the diplomatic art.</p>

<p>The presence of so great an ally, however, could not disguise
the fact of the Conqueror’s defeat; and before the struggle was
allowed to go to further extremes, influences were brought to
bear upon the king which led to a reconciliation. After his
humiliating discomfiture William had retired to Rouen.<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> Robert
is said to have gone to Flanders,<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> though this seems hardly likely
in view of his decisive victory over the royal forces. In any case,
intermediaries now began to pass back and forth between them.
Robert was very willing to make peace and be reconciled with his
father. The barons, too, had little mind for a continuation of
this kind of warfare. Robert’s rebellion had divided many a
family, and it was irksome to the nobles to have to fight against
“sons, brothers, and kinsmen.” Accordingly, Roger of Montgomery,
Hugh of Gournay, Hugh of Grandmesnil, and Roger of
Beaumont and his sons Robert and Henry went to the king and
besought him to be reconciled with his son. They explained that
Robert had been led astray by the evil counsels of depraved
youth—were the ‘depraved youth’ in question the ‘sons and
brothers’ of our respectable negotiators?—that he now repented
of his errors and acknowledged his fault and humbly implored
the royal clemency. The king at first remained obdurate
and complained bitterly against his son. His conduct, he declared,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
had been infamous. He had stirred up civil war and led
away the very flower of the young nobility. He had also brought
in the foreign enemy; and, had it been in his power, he would
have armed the whole human race against his father! The
barons, however, persisted in their efforts. Conferences were
renewed. Bishops and other men of religion, among them St.
Simon of Crépy,<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> an old friend and companion of the Conqueror,
intervened to soften the king’s heart. The queen, too, and ambassadors
from the king of France, and neighboring nobles who
had entered the Conqueror’s service all added their solicitations.
And “at last the stern prince, giving way to the entreaties of so
many persons of rank, and moved also by natural affection, was
reconciled with his son and those who had been leagued with
him.” With the consent of the assembled barons he renewed to
Robert the grant of the succession to Normandy after his death,
upon the same conditions as he had granted it on a former
occasion at Bonneville.<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>It is not clear over how long a period the foregoing negotiations
had been drawn out, though it is not improbable that they were
continued into the spring of 1080;<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> for on 8 May of that year
Gregory VII wrote Robert a letter of fatherly counsel in which he
referred to the reconciliation as good news which had but recently
reached him. The Pope rejoiced that Robert had acquiesced in
his father’s wishes and put away the society of base companions;
while at the same time he solemnly warned him against a return
to his evil courses in the future.<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>Whether or not the Pope’s admonition had anything to do with
it, Robert seems, for a time at least, to have made an earnest
effort to acquiesce in his father’s wishes. The reconciliation was,
so far as can be seen, complete and cordial. Again Robert’s name
begins to appear frequently in the charters of the period, indicating
a full and friendly coöperation with his parents and his
brothers.<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> The king, too, seems so far to have had a change of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
heart as to be willing for the first time in his life to intrust his son
with important enterprises.</p>

<p>In the late summer of 1079, King Malcolm of Scotland had
taken advantage of the Conqueror’s preoccupation with his continental
dominions to harry Northumberland as far south as the
Tyne,<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> and King William had been obliged for the moment to
forego his vengeance. But in the late summer or autumn of
1080 he crossed over to England with Robert,<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> and prepared to
square accounts with his Scottish adversary. Assembling a large
force, which included Abbot Adelelm of Abingdon and a considerable
number of the great barons of England, he placed
Robert in command and sent him northward against the Scottish
raider.<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> Advancing into Lothian,<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> Robert met Malcolm at
Eccles,<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> but found him in no mood for fighting. Ready enough
for raids and plundering when the English armies were at a safe
distance, the Scottish king had no desire for the test of a decisive
engagement. Unless the language of the Abingdon chronicle is
misleading, he again recognized the English suzerainty over his
kingdom and gave hostages for his good faith.<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> Thus enjoying an
easy triumph, Robert turned back southward. Laying the foundations
of ‘New Castle’ upon the Tyne<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> as he passed, he came
again to his father and was duly rewarded for his achievement.<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>Charters indicate that Robert remained in England throughout
the following winter and spring;<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> but before the end of 1081
important events had taken place on the borders of Maine which
called both the king and his son back in haste to the Continent.</p>

<p>Norman rule was always unpopular in Maine, and it created
grave problems. As has already been explained, it had been
temporarily overthrown during the critical years which followed
the Norman conquest of England, and it had been reëstablished
only by force of arms in 1073.<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> But the restoration of Norman
domination in Maine was a serious check to the ambition of Fulk
le Réchin, count of Anjou, who seized every opportunity to cause
embarrassment to his Norman rival. Thus, in the autumn of
1076,<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> he assisted the beleaguered garrison at Dol and was at
least in part responsible for the Conqueror’s discomfiture.<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> So,
too, he made repeated attacks upon John of La Flèche, one of the
most powerful supporters of the Norman interest in Maine.<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
Though the chronology and the details of these events are exceedingly
obscure, there is reason to believe that Fulk’s movements
were in some way connected with the rebellion of Robert Curthose.<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
And while it is impossible to be dogmatic, it is perhaps
not a very hazardous conjecture that upon the outbreak of
Robert’s rebellion, late in 1077, or in 1078, Fulk seized the opportunity
of the king’s embarrassment and preoccupation on the
eastern Norman frontier to launch an expedition against his
hated enemy, John of La Flèche.<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> But Fulk’s hopes were sadly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
disappointed; for John of La Flèche learned of the impending
stroke in time to obtain reënforcements from Normandy,<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> and
Fulk was obliged to retire, severely wounded, from the siege.<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
It was probably after these events that a truce was concluded
between King William and Count Fulk at an unidentified place
called “castellum Vallium,”<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> a truce which appears to have
relieved the Conqueror from further difficulties in Maine until
after his reconciliation with Robert Curthose. In 1081, however,
taking advantage of the absence of the king and Robert in England,
Fulk returned to the attack upon Maine; and this time his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
efforts seem to have met with more success. Again laying siege to
La Flèche, he took it and burned it.<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>It was apparently this reverse sustained by the Norman supporters
in Maine which caused the king and Robert to hasten
back from England in 1081. Levying a great army—sixty
thousand, according to Ordericus!<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>—they hastened towards
La Flèche to meet the victorious Angevins. But when the hostile
armies were drawn up facing each other and the battle was about
to begin,<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> an unnamed cardinal priest<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> and certain monks interposed
their friendly offices in the interest of peace. William of
Évreux and Roger of Montgomery ably seconded their efforts,
and after much negotiation terms were finally agreed upon in the
treaty of La Bruère or Blanchelande (1081). Fulk abandoned
his pretensions to direct rule in Maine and recognized the rights
of Robert Curthose. Robert, on the other hand, recognized the
Angevin overlordship of Maine and formally did homage to Fulk
for the fief. Further, a general amnesty was extended to the
baronage on both sides. John of La Flèche and other Angevin
nobles who had been fighting in the Norman interest were reconciled
with Fulk, and the Manceaux who had supported the
Angevin cause were received back into the good graces of the
king.<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> Finally, there probably was an interchange of hostages
as an assurance of good faith. The so-called Annals of Renaud,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
at any rate, assert that the king’s half-brother and nephew,
Robert of Mortain and his son, and many others were given as
hostages to Fulk.<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>With the conclusion of peace in 1081 the relations between the
Conqueror and the count of Anjou with regard to Maine entered
upon a happier era,<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> though difficulties between them were by
no means at an end. The death of Arnold, bishop of Le Mans, for
example, on 29 November 1081, gave rise to a long dispute as to
the right of patronage over the see. Fulk strongly opposed Hoël,
the Norman candidate, and it was not until 21 April 1085 that
Hoël was finally consecrated by Archbishop William at Rouen
and the Norman rights over the see of Le Mans definitely vindicated.<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
During this same period King William had also to
contend with a very troublesome local insurrection among the
Manceaux. Under the leadership of Hubert, <i>vicomte</i> of Maine,
the rebels installed themselves in the impregnable fortress of
Sainte-Suzanne and maintained themselves there for several years
against all the king’s efforts to dislodge them. At last, in 1085,
or early in 1086, he practically acknowledged his defeat, and
received Hubert, the leader of the rebels, back into his favor.<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>If Robert Curthose played any active part in the dispute with
Count Fulk as to the right of patronage over the see of Le Mans,
or in the siege of Sainte-Suzanne, or, indeed, if he had any actual
share in the government of Maine during this period, the record
of it has not been preserved. Whatever intention the king may
have had of taking his son into a closer coöperation in the management
of his affairs was evidently short-lived, and he continued
to keep the exercise of all authority directly in his own hands.</p>

<p>Such a policy, however, was fatal to the good understanding
that had been established after the siege of Gerberoy, and inevitably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
led to further difficulties. Indeed, it is altogether possible
that Robert was again in exile before the end of 1083. After the
peace of La Bruère he can be traced in a number of charters of
1082 and 1083. On 24 June 1082, he was at Oissel in Normandy.<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>
Once in the same year he was at Downton in England.<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> He was
certainly back in Normandy in association with the king and
queen and William Rufus as late as 18 July 1083.<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> And then
he disappears from view until after the Conqueror’s death in
1087. Evidently another bitter quarrel had intervened and been
followed by a second banishment.</p>

<p>It seems impossible from the confused narrative of Ordericus
Vitalis and the meagre notices of other chroniclers to disentangle
the details of this new controversy. It is clear that the points at
issue had not changed materially since the earlier difficulties.<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[87]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Robert, long since formally recognized as the Conqueror’s heir
and successor designate, to whom the baronage had repeatedly
done homage, could not remain content with the wholly subordinate
position and with the limitations which the king imposed
upon him. His youth, prospects, and affable manners, his
generosity and unrestrained social propensities won him a
numerous following among the younger nobility; and these ambitious
companions in turn spurred him on to make importunate
demands upon his father for larger powers and enjoyments. The
king, on the other hand, could not bring himself to make the
desired concessions. It was no part of the Conqueror’s nature to
share his powers or prerogatives with anyone. Doubtless there
was blame on both sides. Even Ordericus Vitalis hardly justifies
the king. Robert, he says, refused to be obedient, and the king
covered him with reproaches publicly.<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> And so the old controversy
was renewed, and Robert again withdrew from Normandy.
Knight errant that he was, he set out to seek his fortune in foreign
parts—like Polynices the Theban in search of his Adrastus!<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>As to the period of these wanderings, we have no indication
beyond the negative evidence of the charters, in which Robert
does not appear after 1083. It may, perhaps, be conjectured
that the death of the queen (2 November 1083), who had befriended
him during his earlier difficulties with his father, had
removed the support which made possible his continued residence
at the court.<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>Robert’s second exile was evidently longer than the first,<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> and
less filled with active warfare on the frontiers of Normandy. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
seems natural, therefore, to suppose that the distant wanderings
and vicissitudes of which we hear, ‘in Lorraine, Germany, Aquitaine,
and Gascony,’<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> should be assigned to this period. Of
more value, perhaps, than the vague indications of Ordericus
Vitalis, and certainly of greater interest, if true, is the statement
of William of Malmesbury that Robert made his way to Italy and
sought the hand of the greatest heiress of the age, the famous
Countess Matilda of Tuscany, desiring thus to gain support
against his father. In this ambitious project, however, the
courtly exile was doomed to disappointment, for Matilda rejected
his proposal.<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>Failing of his quest in Italy, Robert seems to have returned to
France, and to the satisfaction of his desires among baser associates.
Long banishment and vagabondage had brought on deterioration
of character and led him into habits of loose living<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>
from which the Conqueror was notably free. At some time during
his long exile, he became the father of several illegitimate children.
Ordericus Vitalis puts the story as baldly as possible, asserting
that he became enamored of the handsome concubine of an
aged priest somewhere on the borders of France and had two sons
by her.<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> Both were destined to a tragic death before their
father. One of them, Richard, fell a victim to the evil spell
which lay upon the New Forest, being accidentally slain by an
arrow while hunting there in the year 1100.<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> The other, William,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
after his father’s final defeat at Tinchebray in 1106, went to
Jerusalem and died fighting in the holy wars.<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> Robert also had
an illegitimate daughter, who lived to become the wife of Helias
of Saint-Saëns, most sturdy and loyal of all the supporters of
Robert Curthose in the victorious days of Henry I.<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>Whatever the field of Robert’s obscure wanderings and whatever
the vicissitudes through which he passed, he returned eventually
to France, where he enjoyed the friendship and support of
King Philip.<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> The king of France had momentarily fought upon
the side of the Conqueror at Gerberoy in 1079; but such an alliance
was unnatural and could not last. Hostility between the
two kings was inevitable; and almost the last act of the Conqueror’s
life was a revival of the ancient feud and an attempt to
take vengeance upon the hated overlord who had given asylum
and succor to his rebellious son.<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>The struggle this time raged over the debatable ground of the
Vexin. In the late summer of 1087 King William assembled his
forces and appeared suddenly before the gates of Mantes. The
inhabitants and the garrison, scattered about the countryside,
were taken completely by surprise; and as they fled in wild confusion
back within the walls, the king and his men rushed in after
them, plundered the town, and burned it to the ground.<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>But from that day of vengeance and destruction the Conqueror
returned to Rouen a dying man. There, lingering for some weeks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
at the priory of Saint-Gervais outside the city, he made his final
earthly dispositions. Robert, his undutiful son, was still in
France and at war against him.<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> Whether from conviction of
his incompetence or from resentment at his treason, the king had
arrived at the unalterable decision that Robert, his firstborn,
should not succeed him in England. For that honor he recommended
William Rufus, his second son. Indeed, the dying king,
it seems, would gladly have disinherited his eldest son altogether.<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>
But there were grave difficulties in the way of such a
course. Robert had been formally and repeatedly designated as
his heir and successor.<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> In the last awful moments of his earthly
existence the Conqueror recognized that he did not hold the English
kingdom by hereditary right; he had received it through the
favor of God and victorious battle with Harold.<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> Robert, his
heir, therefore—so he is said to have reasoned—had no claim
upon England. But Normandy he had definitely conceded to him;
and Robert had received the homage of the baronage. The grant
thus made and ratified he could not annul.<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> Moreover, there
were men of weight and influence present at the royal bedside
to plead the exile’s cause. Fearing lest their lord should die with
wrath in his heart against the son who had injured him so deeply,
the assembled prelates and barons, Archbishop William being
their spokesman, endeavored to turn the king’s heart into the
way of forgiveness. At first he was bitter and seemed to be recounting
to himself the manifold injuries that Robert had done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
him; he had sinned against him grievously and brought down his
gray hairs to the grave. But finally, yielding to persuasion and
making the supreme effort of self-conquest, the king called on God
and the assembled magnates to witness that he forgave Robert all
his offences and renewed to him the grant of Normandy<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> and
Maine.<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> A messenger was despatched to France to bear to
Robert the tidings of paternal forgiveness and of his succession
to the duchy.<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> And with these and other final dispositions,
William the Conqueror ended his career upon earth (9 September
1087). His undutiful and rebellious son was not present at the
royal bedside at the end,<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> nor later at the burial in the church of
St. Stephen at Caen.<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p><a name="Footnote_71" id="Footnote_71"></a><a href="#FNanchor_71"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> Ordericus Vitalis is the only early writer who treats in detail of the quarrels
between Robert and the Conqueror. He discusses them at length in two places
(ii, pp. 294-298, 377-390), but unfortunately his accounts are confused and very
difficult to disentangle. There clearly were two quarrels and two periods during
which Robert was in exile. Ordericus himself (ii, p. 390) is specific with regard to
this; and we know independently that the first quarrel—followed by a relatively
short period of exile—ended in the reconciliation after the siege of Gerberoy (1079)
and that Robert was again in exile at the time of the Conqueror’s death (1087).
Pretty clearly the second exile was for a longer period than the first. But the two
accounts of Ordericus do not deal each with one of these quarrels. Rather they both
purport to relate to the earlier quarrel and to the banishment which followed it.
Yet it is obvious that Ordericus, lacking contemporary knowledge of the events, has
confused the two episodes and has related incidents of the latter as if they belonged to
the former. For example (ii, p. 381), he represents Robert as wandering in exile for
a period of five years. Clearly this was not after the first quarrel, to which he relates
it, since that could have been followed by no such extended banishment. In the
narrative detail which follows I have attempted to disentangle the accounts of Ordericus
Vitalis conjecturally, striving to preserve something of the vivacity of
style of the original, without supposing that I have been able to arrive at rigorous
historical accuracy. Ordericus’s own narrative is obviously in a high degree a work
of imagination.</p>

dates the siege in 1079-80. <i>Norman Conquest</i>, iv, pp. 642-643. But Prou has

col. 1219. We have here chronological data of some importance. St. Simon was
present at Compiègne at the translation of the Holy Shroud from its ivory casket
to the magnificent golden reliquary which Queen Matilda had presented to the
church of Saint-Corneille; and on the next day (<i>in crastino itaque solemnitate peracta</i>)
he proceeded to Normandy, where he acted as mediator between the Conqueror
and his rebellious son. A charter by Philip I informs us that the translation of the
Holy Shroud at Compiègne took place on the fourth Sunday of Lent. Prou, <i>Actes
de Philippe Iᵉʳ</i>, no. 126. St. Simon, therefore, left Compiègne for Normandy on the
Monday after Midlent. The year, however, remains in doubt. Presumably it was
1079 or 1080, probably the latter. Philip’s charter (dated 1092) refers to the
translation only incidently and gives no information as to the year in which it occurred.
Ordericus Vitalis (ii, p. 389) indicates that the peace negotiations were protracted:
“Frequenti colloquio Normannici proceres regem allocuti sunt.” It cannot
certainly be said that the reconciliation had been consummated earlier than
Easter (12 April) 1080, on which date Robert joined with the king in the attestation
of a charter. Davis, <i>Regesta</i>, no. 123. Gregory VII, writing on 8 May 1080,
speaks of it as a recent event. <i>Infra</i>, n. 55. Émile Morel, editor of <i>Cartulaire de
l’abbaye de Saint-Corneille de Compiègne</i> (Montdidier, 1904-09), i, p. 53, says that
the translation of the relic took place on 3 April 1082, but he cites no authority, and
I have been able to find none. Jean Pillet says: “Il est constant par des manuscrits
qui parlent de cette translation, qu’elle a été faite … en 1081.” <i>Histoire du
château et de la ville de Gerberoy</i> (Rouen, 1679), p. 85. But he does not indicate where
these ‘manuscripts’ are to be found, and his method of dealing with chronological
problems is so arbitrary as to inspire little confidence.</p>

The letter is of more than passing interest, since it throws much light upon the
matters which had been in controversy and is strongly confirmatory of the narrative
sources. “Insuper monemus et paterne precamur, ut menti tuae semper sit infixum,
quam forti manu, quam divulgata gloria, quicquid pater tuus possideat, ab ore inimicorum
extraxerit; sciens tamen, se non in perpetuum vivere, sed ad hoc tam viriliter

this statement is hardly inconsistent with the Abingdon account. A Durham

was engaged in the north at the siege of Dol. <i>Anjou</i>, pp. 182-183. These
conclusions, however, seem too dogmatic. There is no evidence which indicates a
connection between the attack upon La Flèche and the king’s Breton enterprise;
and it seems hardly likely that Fulk would have entered upon an undertaking
against La Flèche which proved beyond his powers, while he was also operating
against the Conqueror in Brittany. Further, the date 1076 from the <i>Annales de
Saint-Aubin</i> (Halphen, <i>Annales</i>, p. 5) is not to be relied upon: because (1) the
numeral “mlxxvi” is entered twice in the MS., the entry concerning La Flèche
being the second of the two, and no such repetition appears elsewhere in these
annals. We are, therefore, forewarned of a scribal error. And (2) the probability
of such an error is made stronger by the fact that MSS. C, A, and B all
read “mlxxvii,” while the <i>Annales de Saint-Florent</i> (<i>ibid.</i>, p. 119) read “mlxxviii.”
Having no other chronological data than are furnished by these meagre and uncertain
annals, it is impossible to fix the date of the first attack upon La Flèche. It
may have taken place in 1076, 1077, or 1078. On the whole, one of the later dates
seems more probable than 1076, in view of the vague indications of some connection
with Robert’s rebellion (<i>supra</i>, n. 70), and in view of the fact that Fulk was
involved in Breton affairs in 1076.</p>

duke of Brittany; but his narrative is confused—he apparently puts together
the first and second sieges of La Flèche and treats them as one—and it is
impossible to say whether Breton aid was given during Fulk’s first or second
expedition.</p>

<p>Davis cites a “confirmation by William I” in favor of the abbey of Lessay,
which is attested by Robert, along with King William, Bishop Odo of Bayeux,
Henry “the king’s son,” and others, and which he assigns to 1084, remarking,
“The appearance of Bishop Odo is strange, considering that he was at this time in
captivity.” <i>Regesta</i>, no. 199. It cannot, of course, be supposed that the Conqueror
really gave a confirmation in company with Odo of Bayeux while he was
holding the latter in close confinement as a most bitter and dangerous enemy; and
some other explanation of the apparent inconsistency must be found. A glance at
the document as printed in full in <i>Gallia Christiana</i> (xi, instr., cols. 228-229) makes
it clear that we have to do here not with a single diploma of known date, but rather
with a list of notices of gifts. At the head of the list stands the record of a grant
by Roger d’Aubigny, dated 1084, and accompanied by a list of witnesses. Then
follow no less than six separate notices of grants, each with its own witnesses; and
finally come the attestations of King William, Bishop Odo, Henry the king’s son,
Count Robert, and others. There is no reason to suppose that these attestations are
of the year 1084—a date which applies certainly only to the first grant in the list—and
they are evidently of a later period, perhaps of the year 1091, when the abbey
of Lessay might naturally seek a confirmation from the three brothers after the
pacification which followed the siege of Mont-Saint-Michel. The king in question,
therefore, is probably William Rufus rather than the Conqueror. The style
of Henry “filii regis” is certainly surprising, but it can be matched in another document,
also probably of the year 1091. Davis, <i>Regesta</i>, no. 320; cf. The New

<span class="smaller">INDEPENDENT RULE, 1087-95</span></h2>

<p>While William Rufus was hurrying to England to claim the
royal crown, and the young Prince Henry was piously attending
his father’s funeral at Caen, Robert Curthose, hearing the news
of the Conqueror’s death, hastily returned from his long exile, and
upon arriving at Rouen took possession of his inheritance without
encountering any opposition.<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> At last the duchy of Normandy
and the county of Maine, so long denied him by his imperious
father, were within his grasp. No doubt the news of the
king’s death was very welcome to the incorrigible exile; yet it is
pleasant to learn that Robert, upon entering into his inheritance,
was not neglectful of filial duty toward his father’s memory or of
those charitable acts which were regarded as necessary for the
weal of the departed soul. The Conqueror upon his deathbed had
made provision for the distribution of his treasures<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and for the
release of prisoners from his gaols.<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> These dispositions the duke
was careful to carry out, making bounteous distribution of such
treasure as he found to monasteries and churches and to the
poor; while two captives of royal descent—Wulf, son of King
Harold, and Duncan, son of King Malcolm—he not only allowed
to go their way in peace, but honored with the arms of
knighthood.<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Filial piety and the chivalrous impulses of Robert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Curthose were never more happily united. Some of the rare
charters of the duke’s early reign are also indicative of a similar
spirit. Thus we find him confirming to Saint-Étienne of Caen a
grant of the manor of Vains which the Conqueror had made during
his last illness.<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Perhaps not quite the same motive, though
assuredly no spirit of rancor, led him on 7 July 1088 to restore to
La Trinité of Fécamp the lands which his father had taken away
in his wrath.<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>The news of the Conqueror’s death spread with incredible
swiftness,<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and the new duke can hardly have reached Rouen
before a new era (<i>nimia rerum mutatio</i>) had dawned in Normandy.<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
The days of stern government, of enforced peace, of
castles garrisoned and controlled by the duke had passed—at
least until Normandy should again be brought under the heavy
hand of an English king. Robert of Bellême was on his way to
the royal bedside, and had got as far as Brionne, when the news
of the king’s death reached him. Instantly he wheeled his horse,
and, galloping back to Alençon, he took the royal garrison by surprise,
drove it out, and established his own retainers in the castle.
Then, pressing on, he repeated this performance at Bellême and
at other of his strongholds. He also turned upon his weaker
neighbors, and either expelled their garrisons and installed his
own troops in their stead, or razed their castles to the ground in
order that none might stand against him. So, too, William of
Évreux, William of Breteuil, Ralph of Conches, and other lords—most
of them old friends and supporters of Robert Curthose in
rebellious days—expelled the garrisons of King William from
their fortresses and took them into their own hands.<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Already
the stage was set for the private warfare, the pillage, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
harrying that were to reduce Normandy to the verge of chaos.
The monk of Saint-Évroul, whose house was unfortunately located
amid the very worst dens of iniquity, sends up a wail of
lamentation. Robert was duke of Normandy and prince of the
Manceaux in name, indeed; but so sunk was he in sloth and
idleness that his government knew neither virtue nor justice.<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
But to these things it will be necessary to recur in another connection.
It was, in any event, clear from the beginning that the
barons were to enjoy a position of influence, independence, and
power under the new régime such as had been denied them by the
Conqueror.</p>

<p>For some four years before the death of the late king, Bishop
Odo of Bayeux had been held a royal prisoner in the castle of
Rouen. Very reluctantly had the Conqueror, as he lay upon his
deathbed, been prevailed upon to release him.<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> But under the
new duke the fortunes of the bishop again rose rapidly. Not
only did he enjoy freedom, but all his former possessions and
honors in Normandy were restored to him, and he took his place
among the duke’s chief counsellors.<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Soon afterwards he crossed
over to England, and was reëstablished in his former earldom of
Kent.<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> And then, with vaulting ambition, he began to plot the
overthrow of William Rufus and the reuniting of England and
Normandy under the rule of Robert Curthose.</p>

<p>The position of Odo of Bayeux, with his broad holdings and
honors on both sides of the Channel, was typical of that of many
of the Anglo-Norman barons. They had been held by William
the Conqueror under a tight rein, but at least they had had a
single master. Now, however, the two realms were divided, and
the service of two lords presented grave inconveniences. “If we
do our duty to Robert, the duke of Normandy,” they said, “we
shall offend his brother William, and so lose our great revenues
and high honors in England. On the other hand, if we keep our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
fealty to King William, Duke Robert will take from us our patrimonial
estates in Normandy.”<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Further, the accession of two
young and inexperienced princes, after the stern rule and rigorous
repression of the preceding reign, offered a peculiarly tempting
opportunity for rebellion. And as between the two princes, there
could be little doubt on which side the support of most of the
barons would be thrown. Robert was affable, mild, and pliable—for
the turbulent nobles of the eleventh century such a ruler as
they most desired. William, on the other hand, was arrogant and
terrible and likely to be a harsh, unbending master. Moreover,
Robert, as the eldest son, was deemed to have the better right.<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
William Rufus had gained the kingdom largely by virtue of his
own decisive action and the support of Archbishop Lanfranc.
Though publicly acknowledged, his tenure of the English crown
was by no means unreservedly accepted by the baronage in England.<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
Accordingly, late in 1087, or more probably early in the
spring of 1088,<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> a conspiracy with wide ramifications was formed
for his overthrow and for the transfer of the kingdom to Robert
Curthose. “In this year,” says the Chronicler, “this land was
much disturbed and filled with great treason, so that the most
powerful Frenchmen that were in this land would betray their
lord the king, and would have for king his brother Robert who
was count of Normandy.”<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>The beginnings of this treasonable enterprise are obscure, and
it is impossible to say with certainty on which side of the Channel
the plot was hatched.<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Bishop Odo of Bayeux was unquestionably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
its prime mover, and of his activities we have some knowledge.
Having risen to honor and power in Normandy, he had
crossed over to England before the end of 1087 and was in attendance
at the king’s Christmas court,<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> apparently in the full enjoyment
of his English earldom.<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> But he may even then have
been contemplating treason. Certainly the inception of the great
conspiracy both in England and in Normandy can hardly have
been delayed long afterwards. During the early spring secret
negotiations were active, and frequent messages must have been
exchanged between England and the Continent.<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> One after
another the great nobles and prelates were won over. Even William
of Saint-Calais, bishop of Durham, who had been raised by
William Rufus to the position of chief trust in the kingdom, was
widely believed to have joined the conspiracy.<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Before the close
of Lent<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> the greater part of the Anglo-Norman baronage had
strengthened the defences of their castles and broken into open
revolt. The rebellion extended from the south coast to Northumberland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
and from East Anglia to the Welsh border.<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> But the
centre and heart of the movement, so far, at any rate, as it concerns
the life of Robert Curthose, lay in the southeast of England,
where Bishop Odo and his immediate supporters had established
themselves in strategic positions in the strongholds of Rochester<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
and Pevensey.<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>Duke Robert’s connection with the great rebellion of 1088 in its
early stages is by no means clear. According to one of the later
writers, upon learning that his brother had gone to England to
claim the royal crown, Robert had sworn a great oath by the angels
of God, declaring that though he were in distant Alexandria, the
English would await his coming and make him king.<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Actually,
however, he seems to have reconciled himself to the accomplished
fact,<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> and not to have contemplated an attack upon England
until the barons, taking the initiative, informed him of their plan
for the overthrow of William Rufus.<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Upon hearing this good
news, however, he promptly approved the project and promised
the conspirators every possible aid and support.<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> As an earnest
of his intention, he sent Eustace of Boulogne and Robert of Bellême
with their retainers on in advance to England, where they
were installed by Bishop Odo in the great fortress of Rochester.
Meanwhile, he undertook to collect a fleet and to prepare for
an invasion in force.<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>But the levy and equipment of an expedition for a second Norman
conquest of England was an undertaking for which the resources
of the duke were little able to provide. Careless, prodigal,
incurably fond of good living, Robert was by nature impecunious.
The unsettling transformation that had come over the
duchy upon his accession was little likely to recruit his financial
resources. The sudden increase in the power and independence
of the nobility, the disturbed state of the country, the lavish
grant of emoluments to all who asked, the charitable distribution
of the Conqueror’s treasure to religious houses, all these things
inevitably depleted the ducal resources. And further, under the
terms of the late king’s will, 5000 livres had been paid out to
make provision for Prince Henry.<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>As compared with Robert, who had squandered his treasure in
reckless extravagance, Prince Henry enjoyed a certain opulence.
Pious attendance at the Conqueror’s obsequies had not prevented
his having his treasure weighed out to the last farthing, “in order
that nothing should be lacking,” and putting it in a place of security
among friends upon whom he could rely.<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Without land
which he could call his own, and placed in a somewhat difficult
position between the rival interests of his brothers, he had stood
carefully upon his guard, frugally husbanding his resources, and
holding himself in readiness to take sides with either of his
brothers, or with neither, as his own interests should decide.<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
He was more drawn to Robert, however, because of his mildness
and good nature,<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> and for a time he remained with him in Normandy.<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
To Henry, accordingly, Robert appealed in 1088 for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
funds to be used in the invasion of England. But gifts without
reward Henry would not give. Soon, however, fresh messengers
from the duke brought the welcome news that Robert was willing
to sell him a part of his lands; whereupon Henry became more
pliable, and a bargain was soon struck. For 3000 livres the duke
handed over to him the whole of the Cotentin, Avranches, and
Mont-Saint-Michel, together with the great Norman lordship of
Earl Hugh of Chester.<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> Thus Robert obtained a supply of ready
cash to equip his forces for the invasion of England, though at the
expense of alienating a part of his birthright. This was but the
beginning of a policy of short-sighted expedients in lieu of effective
government, which in the end was to prove fatal to his rule.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the rebellion had taken a course which was disastrous
for Robert’s cause in England. William Rufus, finding
that the greater part of the Anglo-Norman baronage had deserted
him, turned for support to his native English subjects, and
his appeal to them was not made in vain.<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Gathering together
such forces as he could, he marched straight upon Tunbridge and
took the place by storm. Then he pushed on towards Rochester,
expecting to find Odo of Bayeux and the main body of the rebel
forces. But the bishop had learned of his coming and had slipped
out of Rochester and gone to Pevensey, where he joined Robert
of Mortain in the defence of the castle, while they awaited the
arrival of Robert Curthose with the expedition from Normandy.
But the king was informed of the bishop’s movement, and, abandoning
his proposed attack upon Rochester, he marched southward
upon Pevensey and began a protracted siege of the castle.<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile, the long expected fleet from Normandy did not
appear. One writer complains that the duke dallied away his
time with amusements ill befitting a man.<a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Indeed, so widespread
was the English rebellion that the kingdom appeared to be
almost within his grasp, if only he had bestirred himself to seize
it.<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Yet with William Rufus loyally supported by an English
army and pushing his campaign with the utmost vigor, everything
depended upon the promptness with which the duke could
land troops in England to support the rebels. It was doubtless the
knowledge of this pressing need which induced Robert to send
forward a part of his forces in advance, while he himself remained
in Normandy to make more extended preparations.<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> But the
vanguard of the ducal fleet met with a disaster which proved fatal
to the whole insurrectionary movement. While William Rufus
himself maintained a close investment of Pevensey, he had sent
his ships to sea to ward off the threatened attack. And as the
Norman fleet approached the English coast, the rival forces
joined in battle, and the invaders were overwhelmingly defeated.
To add to the catastrophe, a sudden calm cut off every possibility
of escape to the Norman forces. According to contemporary
writers the multitude that perished was beyond all reckoning.<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>Disaster followed hard upon disaster. Bishop Odo, the count
of Mortain, and the garrison of Pevensey were reduced by starvation
and obliged to surrender after a six weeks’ resistance.<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> The
bishop gave himself up, and solemnly promised upon oath to procure
the surrender of Rochester and then depart the kingdom forever.
Upon this understanding the king, suspecting no ruse or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
bad faith, sent him off with a small force to receive the submission
of Rochester. But the great fortress, the chief stronghold of the
rebels in southeastern England, was held by a strong garrison and
able leaders whom the duke had sent from Normandy,<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> such warriors
as Eustace of Boulogne and Robert of Bellême and two of
his brothers, men of intrepid courage, who were unwilling to
admit the hopelessness of their cause. And when Odo appeared
before the castle with the royal troops and summoned them to
surrender, they suddenly sallied forth, seized both the bishop and
his captors, and carried the whole party within the walls.<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> Outwitted
by this clever ruse, the king was again obliged to summon
his English supporters<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> and lay siege to Rochester. But still no
reënforcements arrived from Normandy, and again the royal
arms enjoyed a triumph. The defenders of Rochester were
obliged to surrender;<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> and the traitor bishop was now at last
deprived of all his revenues and honors in England and driven
over sea forever.<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> Doubtless other rebels were sent into exile
with him.<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> But William Rufus with politic foresight tempered
his animosity against many and admitted them to reconciliation.<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>With the destruction of Duke Robert’s fleet, the reduction of
Pevensey and Rochester, and the expulsion of Odo of Bayeux from
England, the force of the rebellion had been broken. Whatever
plans the duke may have had to follow with a greater fleet were
perforce abandoned. Through his own weakness and procrastination,
coupled with the vigor and resourcefulness of William
Rufus and the loyalty of the native English, the attempt to place
Robert Curthose upon the throne of England, at one time so
promising, had ended in utter failure.</p>

<p>But Robert’s failure did not end the hostility between the two
brothers. No peace negotiations intervened. William Rufus continued
to nurse his indignation and to thirst for vengeance. He
professed to fear some further mischief from the duke.<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> Robert,
too, remained suspicious and apprehensive. Prince Henry, learning
of the fall of Rochester, and eager to conciliate the victor, had
hastened across the Channel to visit the king and crave from him
“the lands of his mother” to which he laid claim.<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> The duke
regarded this move with little favor; and when, soon after,<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
Henry had accomplished his mission and was returning to Normandy
in company with Robert of Bellême, who had also been
reconciled with William Rufus, the duke had him seized at the
landing and placed in custody. Malicious enemies, we are told,
had poisoned the duke’s mind with the belief that Henry and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Robert of Bellême had not only made their peace with the king,
but had entered into a sworn agreement to his own hurt.<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> Henry
was released from prison some six months later, at the solicitation
of the Norman barons,<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> and the incident is not, perhaps, of great
importance—for, if Henry and the king had arrived at any
understanding, it must have been of short duration—yet it
serves to illustrate the strained relations which continued to exist
between Robert Curthose and William Rufus.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the king, at last secure in his possession of the
English throne, began to develop plans for taking vengeance upon
the duke. If we can rely upon the unsupported statement of
Ordericus Vitalis in such a matter, he held a formal assembly of
his barons at Winchester, apparently in 1089,<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> and laid before
them proposals for an attack upon Normandy. He harangued
the assembled magnates upon the faithless conduct of his brother
and upon the state of unchecked anarchy into which he had
allowed his duchy to fall. The whole country, he declared, had
become a prey to thieves and robbers, and the lamentations of
the clergy had reached him from beyond the sea. It behooved
him, therefore, as the son of his father, to send to Normandy for
the succor of holy church, for the protection of widows and
orphans, and for the just punishment of plunderers and assassins.
Upon being asked their advice, the assembled nobles promptly
approved the king’s project.<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> Perhaps some of the quondam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
rebels reasoned that, since the two realms could not be reunited
under the weak and pliable Robert, it would still be worth their
while to attempt to bring about the desired union under his more
masterful brother.<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>The king’s plan evidently did not involve immediate open war
upon Robert Curthose. It was not the way of William Rufus to
attempt upon the field of battle that which might more expeditiously
be accomplished through diplomacy. This was a form of
attack which the impoverished duke was little qualified to combat.
Choosing as the field of his activities the Norman lands
lying north and east of the Seine, William Rufus began by winning
over by bribery the garrison of Saint-Valery at the mouth of the
Somme, thus gaining a strong castle and a commodious seaport in
a position most advantageously located for the further prosecution
of his design. It must have been at about the same time that
Stephen of Aumale yielded to the same golden argument, and
opened the gates of his stronghold to the soldiers of King William.
From these convenient bases plundering raids were then carried
into the surrounding country.<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> Soon the contagion spread
farther. Gerard of Gournay placed his castles of Gournay, La
Ferté-en-Bray, and Gaillefontaine at the disposal of the king, and
actively devoted himself to the promotion of the English cause
among his neighbors. His example was promptly followed by
Robert of Eu and Walter Giffard, lord of Longueville, and by
Ralph of Mortemer. In short, by an effective blending of bribery
and diplomacy, William Rufus had succeeded in detaching the
greater part of the Norman nobles dwelling upon the right bank
of the Seine from their allegiance to the duke.<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>The single notable exception appears to have been Helias of
Saint-Saëns, to whom Robert had given his illegitimate daughter,
and with her the castles of Arques and Bures and their appurtenant
lands as a marriage portion. Firmly establishing his son-in-law
at Saint-Saëns, Arques, and Bures, the duke intended that
he should stand as a counterpoise to the rapidly growing English
influence east of the Seine.<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> And his expectations were not
disappointed. Through every adversity, Helias of Saint-Saëns
remained staunchly loyal to the cause of Robert Curthose and of
his son, long after the final triumph of Henry I at Tinchebray.</p>

<p>Of other measures taken by the duke to combat the insidious
aggression of his more resourceful rival, we have only the most
fragmentary knowledge. From one of Robert’s charters, it appears
that he besieged and captured the castle of Eu in 1089.<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
This, it seems not improbable, was one of his early and successful
efforts against the Norman traitors and their English ally. We
know, too, that in his extreme need he appealed to his overlord,
the king of France. Yet here again our information is discouragingly
fragmentary. Of the relations between the duke and his
overlord after the death of William the Conqueror we know
nothing except that on 24 April 1089 Robert was at Vernon on
the Seine frontier, engaged in some sort of hostile enterprise
against France.<a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> Certain it is, however, that before the close of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
this year he had sought and obtained the aid of King Philip
against his Anglo-Norman enemies in the lands east of the
Seine.<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> Together they laid siege to La Ferté-en-Bray,<a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> the
castle of Gerard of Gournay. But again the golden diplomacy of
William Rufus proved more than a match for the vanishing resources
of the duke. “No small quantity of money having been
transmitted secretly to King Philip,” he was readily induced to
abandon the siege and return home.<a name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>In 1090 difficulties continued to multiply around Duke Robert.
In the city of Rouen itself William Rufus had contrived through
bribery to gain a following, and had set himself to promote civic
discord as a means of undermining the duke’s authority.<a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> In
November 1090 a factional conflict broke out in Rouen between
two parties of the burghers, the <i>Pilatenses</i> and <i>Calloenses</i>. Of the
latter we know no more than that they were the supporters of the
duke and that they were the weaker of the two factions.<a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> The
<i>Pilatenses</i> were ably led by a certain Conan, son of Gilbert Pilatus,
described as the wealthiest citizen of Rouen. His great riches
enabled him to maintain a large household of retainers in opposition
to the duke and to draw into his faction the greater part of
the citizens. As a further resource, Conan had covenanted with
William Rufus to deliver up to him the city. An insurrection was
planned to take place on 3 November; and at the appointed hour
the king’s hirelings were to come from Gournay and other neighboring
fortresses to support the rising. Some of the king’s adherents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
had already secretly been brought within the walls, ready
to join the rebels at the appointed moment.<a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>The duke learned late of the events that were impending and
had barely time to call up reënforcements. Hasty summonses
were sent to William of Évreux, Robert of Bellême, William of
Breteuil, and Gilbert of Laigle. More important still, Prince
Henry was induced to forget past wrongs and come to the duke’s
assistance in this hour of need. These measures were taken
barely in time to avert a disaster. Henry, apparently, was already
within the city before the outbreak; but as Gilbert of Laigle with a
troop of horse galloped across the bridge over the Seine and
entered Rouen from the south, Reginald of Warenne with three
hundred supporters of William Rufus was already battering at
the western gate. Meanwhile, within the city the insurrection had
broken out amid scenes of wild confusion. Robert and Henry
issued from the citadel and began to attack the rebels upon front
and rear. Robert was personally brave and a sturdy fighter, and
on later occasions he proved himself an excellent leader in emergencies.
But in the wild confusion and uncertainties of the
Rouen insurrection, his friends became alarmed lest some serious
mishap should befall him, and persuaded him to retire to a place
of safety and not expose himself to such grave perils until the
issue of the conflict should be decided. Accordingly, he withdrew
by the eastern gate into the Faubourg Malpalu, and, there taking
a boat across the Seine to Émendreville, he found shelter in the
priory of Notre-Dame-du-Pré.<a name="FNanchor_242" id="FNanchor_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> Meanwhile, within the city,
Henry and Gilbert of Laigle and their supporters put down the
insurrection with a great slaughter of the inhabitants. Conan
and many other rebels were captured, and the hirelings of William
Rufus were obliged to withdraw in confusion and seek the shelter
of a neighboring wood, until under the cover of darkness they
were able to make good their escape. With the triumph of his
forces, the duke returned to the city, and, with his habitual mildness,
was for throwing Conan into a dungeon and showing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
clemency to the rest of the rebels. But his barons had other
views, and insisted upon taking a savage vengeance upon the
burghers who had been involved in the treason. William, son of
Ansger, one of the richest men in the city, was led away into
captivity by William of Breteuil and held for a ransom of 3000
livres. As for Conan, the archtraitor, Prince Henry craved leave
of the duke to dispose of him in his own way. Taking him up to
the upper story of the tower of Rouen, where a window commanded
a view of the surrounding country, he called upon the
wretch to view the beauties of the landscape as it stretched away
across the Seine; and then, swearing by the soul of his mother
that a traitor should not be admitted to ransom, he thrust him
backwards through the window. The place, says Ordericus
Vitalis, is known as Conan’s Leap “unto this day.”<a name="FNanchor_243" id="FNanchor_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>The failure of William Rufus to overthrow the authority of
Robert Curthose in Rouen by stirring up an insurrection did not
put a check upon his ambitious projects elsewhere. In this same
month of November 1090 private war broke out between William
of Évreux and Ralph of Conches. The latter appealed to
the duke for aid, but got no encouragement; whereupon he
turned to William Rufus, and found him altogether too alert to
let slip so good an opportunity of extending his influence. The
king promptly directed his Norman allies, Stephen of Aumale
and Gerard of Gournay, to send reinforcements to Conches.<a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
And so the English sphere of influence was extended to the
left bank of the Seine. But William Rufus was now preparing
for more direct action against the waning power of the duke.
By long and patient diplomacy, coupled with a liberal expenditure
of English treasure, he had succeeded in undermining
his authority in a large portion of the duchy. At the close of
January, or early in February 1091<a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> he himself crossed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Normandy with a considerable fleet and established his headquarters
at Eu.<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>The news of the king’s landing came like a thunderclap to the
duke, who at the moment was engaged with Robert of Bellême in
the siege of Courcy. The siege was immediately abandoned, but
the barons, instead of standing with their own ruler against the
invader, departed each to his own castle; and presently “almost
all the great lords of Normandy” began paying their court to
William Rufus, who received them with great cordiality and gave
them handsome presents. But the movement in support of the
English king was not confined to the barons of Normandy alone.
Adventurers from Brittany, France, and Flanders also gathered
at Eu to swell the royal forces.<a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> Again, as in 1089, Robert in his
extreme need appealed to his overlord, the king of France. And
again King Philip responded to his call; and together they
marched against the invaders at Eu.<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> But apparently there was
no serious fighting. Whether William Rufus again contrived to
weaken the king’s determination, as he had done on a similar
occasion at La Ferté, with a fresh supply of English gold, we have
no knowledge. In any case, a peace<a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> was soon negotiated between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
the brothers, apparently at Rouen<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> during the month
of February.<a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>The sources are not in complete accord as to the terms of this
pacification; but they seem to be mutually supplementary
rather than contradictory. Apparently William Rufus smoothed
the way for the negotiations with <i>ingentia dona</i><a name="FNanchor_252" id="FNanchor_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>—it always
seems to have been beyond the power of Robert Curthose to resist
the temptation of such ephemeral advantages—but it was
the duke who made the fatal concessions. He gave up the abbey
of Fécamp,<a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> the counties of Eu and Aumale,<a name="FNanchor_254" id="FNanchor_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> and the lands of
Gerard of Gournay and Ralph of Conches, together with their
strongholds (<i>municipia</i>) and the strongholds of their vassals
(<i>subjecti</i>)<a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>—in a word, all the lands which the king had won
from the duke and had occupied with his adherents on both
banks of the Seine in eastern Normandy.<a name="FNanchor_256" id="FNanchor_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> Further, in the
west the king was to have the important seaport of Cherbourg
and the great abbey stronghold of Mont-Saint-Michel,<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> concessions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
which looked ominous for Henry, count of the Cotentin.
On his side, William Rufus pledged himself to help Robert
recover the county of Maine,<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> then in revolt against Norman
rule, and all Norman lands which the Conqueror had ever held
and whose lords were then resisting the duke’s authority, except,
of course, the lands just noted which by the terms of the
present treaty were ceded to the king.<a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> For the benefit of the
barons on both sides who had treasonably supported the king or
the duke in their recent quarrels, a general amnesty was added.
The Norman barons whose defection had brought about the
duke’s downfall and whose allegiance was now being transferred
to the king, were to occupy their Norman fiefs in peace and to be
held guiltless. And all the nobles who had been deprived of their
English lands for supporting the duke were now to receive them
back.<a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> Further, an attempt was made to forestall a possible
succession controversy by providing that if either of the brothers
should die without a son born in lawful wedlock, the survivor
should become sole heir of all his dominions.<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> And finally, in
order to give the treaty the most solemn and binding character,
it was formally confirmed by the oaths of twelve great barons on
behalf of the king and of an equal number on behalf of the duke.<a name="FNanchor_262" id="FNanchor_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>It may, perhaps, be doubted whether William Rufus seriously
intended to exert himself to carry out the provisions of this treaty,
except in so far as his own interests dictated; although William of
Malmesbury affirms that the king and the duke in pursuance of
their agreement immediately took in hand the preparation of an
expedition against Maine, and were only turned back from it by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
the disconcerting action of their younger brother, Prince Henry.<a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>
The details of Henry’s movements after the death of the Conqueror
are obscure and uncertain, though the main lines of his
policy and conduct seem clear enough. His relations had not been
uniformly harmonious with either of his brothers. As has already
been pointed out, his early friendship with the duke and his
acquisition of the Cotentin had been followed by a period of
imprisonment.<a name="FNanchor_264" id="FNanchor_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> Apparently, too, Duke Robert, after he had
squandered the money which he had obtained from Henry in
exchange for the Cotentin, had endeavored to dispossess the
young prince of the lands he had granted him, and had only been
prevented from so doing by a show of force.<a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> It was only a temporary
reconciliation which had gained for the duke the important
services of Henry during the insurrection at Rouen in
November 1090. Fresh misunderstandings soon followed, and
Henry was again obliged to retire to his lands in the Cotentin,<a name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>
where he gained the warm friendship of his father’s old vassals,
Hugh of Avranches and Richard de Redvers, and devoted himself
with energy to the strengthening of his castles at Avranches,
Cherbourg, Coutances, and Gavray.<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> With William Rufus, too,
he had a quarrel of long standing. The early hopes raised by his
visit to the king after the fall of Rochester in 1088<a name="FNanchor_268" id="FNanchor_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> had not been
fulfilled. The English lands of Matilda to which he laid claim had
been granted to Robert Fitz Hamon, and he had been able to
obtain no redress.<a name="FNanchor_269" id="FNanchor_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> It was even said that he had assisted the
duke at Rouen out of a desire for vengeance upon the king.<a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
Finally, the treaty of peace which William and Robert had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
recently concluded was manifestly aimed directly against him.
They had planned between themselves for an exclusive partition
of all the Conqueror’s dominions, and for a recovery of ducal
authority at all points where it was being defied. That obviously
meant, among other places, in the Cotentin; and the clauses ceding
Mont-Saint-Michel and Cherbourg to William Rufus were not
likely to remain a dead letter. Henry realized the menace and
protested vigorously against the injustice of a plan to deprive him
of all share in the dominions of his glorious father.<a name="FNanchor_271" id="FNanchor_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> He collected
troops wherever he could find them in Brittany or Normandy,
reënforced the defences of Coutances and Avranches with
feverish energy, and prepared for war.<a name="FNanchor_272" id="FNanchor_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>Whatever the original destination of the expedition which the
duke and the king had prepared, they suddenly turned it against
their obstreperous brother who was presuming to resist them, and
soon drove him to the last extremity.<a name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> Henry’s resistance was a
forlorn hope from the beginning. Hugh of Avranches and other
nobles who had previously been his enthusiastic supporters
against the duke, but who had important holdings across the
Channel, now prudently reflected that it would be unwise to incur
the wrath of William Rufus, and in view of the meagreness of
Henry’s resources they discreetly surrendered their strongholds.<a name="FNanchor_274" id="FNanchor_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>
Thus deserted and overwhelmed on every side, Henry was driven
from the mainland; but by favor of some of the monks<a name="FNanchor_275" id="FNanchor_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> he
gained entrance to the monastery of Mont-Saint-Michel, and
there in the famous abbey fortress he determined to make a last
stand.</p>

<p>For two weeks, about the middle of Lent,<a name="FNanchor_276" id="FNanchor_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> William Rufus and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
Robert Curthose besieged him.<a name="FNanchor_277" id="FNanchor_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> Stretching their forces about
the bay of Mont-Saint-Michel from Genêts on the north past
Ardevon to the Couesnon on the south, they completely invested
the Mount upon the landward side, and, as Henry was without
naval resources, this constituted an effective blockade. The duke
had his headquarters at Genêts, while the king established himself
at Avranches.<a name="FNanchor_278" id="FNanchor_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> The scene was enlivened from day to day by the
knightly joustings of the opposing forces upon the sandy beach.<a name="FNanchor_279" id="FNanchor_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>
William Rufus himself was once engaged in these feats of arms to
his grave humiliation, being unhorsed by a simple knight.<a name="FNanchor_280" id="FNanchor_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>
Meanwhile, the besieged garrison was rapidly being reduced to
desperate straits. Though the food supply was adequate, there
was great lack of water. Manifestly a close maintenance of the
blockade would quickly have forced a surrender. But Robert
Curthose had too chivalrous a heart to let his brother suffer from
thirst. He directed the guards to keep their watch a little carelessly
in order that Henry’s servants might occasionally pass
through the lines and fetch water.<a name="FNanchor_281" id="FNanchor_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> Wace affirms that he even
sent Henry a tun of wine.<a name="FNanchor_282" id="FNanchor_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> Such chivalrous and impractical
generosity was beyond the comprehension of William Rufus, who
upbraided the duke and came near disrupting their alliance and
withdrawing from the siege.<a name="FNanchor_283" id="FNanchor_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> But Henry soon saw the hopelessness
of his plight, and, “reflecting upon the changing fortunes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
of mortals, determined to save himself for better times.” He
offered to capitulate upon honorable terms, and William and
Robert readily agreed to his proposals, and allowed him to march
out with his garrison under arms.<a name="FNanchor_284" id="FNanchor_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> Henry’s subsequent fortunes
are obscure. Ordericus Vitalis recounts some heroic details of his
wanderings and vicissitudes in exile.<a name="FNanchor_285" id="FNanchor_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> But it is clear that some
definite reconciliation was arranged with his brothers before the
end of summer, for early in August we find him crossing with
them to England to join in an expedition against the king of
Scotland.<a name="FNanchor_286" id="FNanchor_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, having disposed of the factious opposition of the
would-be count of the Cotentin, the allied brothers turned their
attention to other problems within the duchy. Ordericus Vitalis
affirms that for almost two years after the siege of Mont-Saint-Michel
Normandy was free from wars,<a name="FNanchor_287" id="FNanchor_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> though it must be confessed
that his own more detailed record on other pages does not
bear him out in this general assertion. The mere fact, however,
that William Rufus had changed from an insidious enemy into an
active ally, present in the duchy, was in itself a guarantee of more
vigorous government. But more convincing evidence that William
and Robert had determined upon a programme of greater
rigor in the enforcement of ducal rights, and upon a systematic
recovery of the ducal prerogatives which had been usurped by the
baronage during the recent disorders, has been preserved in a
unique document which records the Norman <i>Consuetudines et
Iusticie</i> as they existed under William the Conqueror. On 18
July 1091, the allied brothers assembled the bishops and lay
barons at Caen and held a formal inquest into the ducal rights
and customs which had prevailed in their father’s lifetime. The
prohibition upon the building of adulterine castles, the ducal
right to garrison private strongholds and take hostages of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
holders, the limitations upon private warfare, all these things and
much besides, which had been firm custom in the Conqueror’s
time, were now revived and carefully reduced to writing.<a name="FNanchor_288" id="FNanchor_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> If
these measures were not in exact pursuance of the provisions of
the treaty of the previous spring, they certainly were in accord
with its spirit. Manifestly a new régime was in contemplation.</p>

<p>Quite unexpectedly, however, these plans for a restoration of
public order in Normandy were interrupted by the arrival of news
from across the Channel which demanded the immediate presence
of the king and his ally in England.<a name="FNanchor_289" id="FNanchor_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> Serious disturbances had
broken out on the Welsh border, and King Malcolm of Scotland
had made a destructive raid into the north of England. The
inquest at Caen had been held on 18 July. Early in August, or
perhaps even before the end of July,<a name="FNanchor_290" id="FNanchor_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> William and Robert, accompanied
by Prince Henry,<a name="FNanchor_291" id="FNanchor_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> departed for England. So unexpectedly
had these changes of plan been made as to provoke
general consternation.<a name="FNanchor_292" id="FNanchor_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>Of the king’s campaign against the Welsh we know nothing save
that he met with small success,<a name="FNanchor_293" id="FNanchor_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> and there is no evidence that
Duke Robert played any part in it. It was the Scotch expedition,
coming after it, which claimed the interest of contemporary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
writers. Large preparations were made for a northern war both
by land and by sea.<a name="FNanchor_294" id="FNanchor_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> But the fleet which was sent northward in
September was wrecked a few days before Michaelmas;<a name="FNanchor_295" id="FNanchor_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> and the
land forces led by the king and the duke were evidently still later
in advancing. If we can trust our dating, they did not reach Durham
till 14 November.<a name="FNanchor_296" id="FNanchor_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> On that day the king formally reinstated
William of Saint-Calais in the bishopric of Durham.<a name="FNanchor_297" id="FNanchor_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>
Then pushing on northward into Lothian,<a name="FNanchor_298" id="FNanchor_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> he found that Malcolm
had come to meet him with a formidable army. The situation
was strikingly like that of eleven years earlier when Robert
Curthose at the head of the Conqueror’s forces had crossed the
Tweed to avenge King Malcolm’s raid of 1079.<a name="FNanchor_299" id="FNanchor_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> The hostile
armies stood facing each other, but again there was no battle.
And again, as formerly, it was Robert Curthose who procured a
peaceful renewal of the Scotch king’s homage. Supported by
Edgar Atheling, scion of the old English royal line, who was then
with Malcolm’s forces, he undertook negotiations.<a name="FNanchor_300" id="FNanchor_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> Malcolm,
we are told, was not unmindful of his old friendship for the duke,
and even admitted that, at the Conqueror’s bidding, he had done
homage to Robert as his eldest son and heir.<a name="FNanchor_301" id="FNanchor_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> This obligation
he would fully recognize; but to William Rufus, he declared, he
owed nothing. This was shrewd diplomacy, but Robert, unmoved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
by it, tactfully explained that the times had changed; and
after some further parley, Malcolm consented to an interview
with the English king and to the conclusion of a peace<a name="FNanchor_302" id="FNanchor_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> upon the
basis of the old agreement which had bound him to the Conqueror.
To William Rufus he renewed his homage and received from him
a regrant of all his English lands. Florence of Worcester adds
that the English king undertook to pay him an annual pension of
twelve marks of gold.<a name="FNanchor_303" id="FNanchor_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> It was never the way of William Rufus
to hazard in battle what he could more surely gain through a
politic expenditure of English treasure.</p>

<p>From the meeting with Malcolm in Lothian the allied brothers
moved back southward into Wessex.<a name="FNanchor_304" id="FNanchor_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> Robert remained in England
almost until Christmas. He had rendered important services
in the negotiations with Malcolm, and he might justly look to
William Rufus for continued friendly coöperation under the
terms of the treaty which they had concluded in Normandy the
previous spring. But he now discovered that the king’s friendship
was “more feigned than real.”<a name="FNanchor_305" id="FNanchor_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> William Rufus was no
longer minded to abide by the terms of their alliance—probably,
that is, he was not willing again to cross the Channel with Robert
and assist him in the work of reëstablishing his authority in the
lands of Normandy and Maine which had fallen away from their
obedience. Accordingly, the duke withdrew in dudgeon, and,
taking ship from the Isle of Wight, returned to Normandy, 23
December 1091.<a name="FNanchor_306" id="FNanchor_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>During the four years of Robert’s reign which we have so far
passed in review, his attention had been in the main absorbed by
his relations with William Rufus, first in an effort to overthrow
him and obtain the English crown, then in a struggle to preserve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
his own duchy from English conquest, and finally in an effort to
coöperate with his brother in a friendly alliance which, after
drawing him away on distant enterprises, had proved a hollow
mockery. During this same period other problems had pressed
upon the duke, in the solution of which he had met with little
better success. Indeed, the county of Maine had already slipped
entirely from his grasp.</p>

<p>The historian of the bishops of Le Mans records that the death
of William the Conqueror produced a ferment throughout the
whole of Maine;<a name="FNanchor_307" id="FNanchor_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> and there is some reason for believing that
very early in his reign Robert Curthose had led a Norman army
against the Manceaux and had suppressed an incipient rebellion.<a name="FNanchor_308" id="FNanchor_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>
In the absence of convincing evidence, however, it seems
more probable that Maine was not disturbed during the first year
of Robert’s rule by more than local disorders, and that his first
expedition into the county did not take place until the late summer
of 1088. Upon the fall of Rochester and the failure of his
attempted invasion of England, the duke—acting, it is said,
upon the advice of Odo of Bayeux,<a name="FNanchor_309" id="FNanchor_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> who had now returned to
Normandy to pursue his restless ambition<a name="FNanchor_310" id="FNanchor_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>—assembled an
army and determined to march into Maine and assert his authority.
Probably the expedition was intended primarily as a formal
progress for receiving the homage of the lords of Maine, for the
county was disturbed by no general revolt at that time. Robert’s
garrison still held the castle of Le Mans securely, and Bishop
Hoël and the clergy and people of the city were loyal.<a name="FNanchor_311" id="FNanchor_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> Placing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
Bishop Odo, William of Évreux, Ralph of Conches, and William
of Breteuil at the head of his forces, the duke moved southward,
apparently in August 1088, and, encountering no opposition,
entered Le Mans, where he was received by the clergy and people
with demonstrations of loyalty.<a name="FNanchor_312" id="FNanchor_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> The great barons, Geoffrey of
Mayenne, Robert the Burgundian, and Helias, son of John of La
Flèche, whatever their secret feelings, came forward promptly
with offers of loyal service.<a name="FNanchor_313" id="FNanchor_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> Only Pain de Mondoubleau, collecting
his retainers in the castle of Ballon, dared to offer resistance;
and early in September<a name="FNanchor_314" id="FNanchor_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> he was reduced to submission.
Everywhere Robert’s authority appeared to be firmly established;<a name="FNanchor_315" id="FNanchor_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>
and as he returned to Normandy to wage war against
the rebellious house of Talvas, he was able to recruit his army
from the Manceaux as well as from the Normans.<a name="FNanchor_316" id="FNanchor_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p>Yet the following year there appear to have been fresh disturbances
in Maine. By this time Robert had his hands full with
the hostile activity of William Rufus and with the growing defection
of the Norman barons in the lands east of the Seine; and as
he appealed to his overlord, King Philip, for aid in Normandy,<a name="FNanchor_317" id="FNanchor_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>
so he turned to his other overlord, Fulk le Réchin, for assistance
against the Manceaux.<a name="FNanchor_318" id="FNanchor_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> If we could accept the hardly credible
account of Ordericus Vitalis,<a name="FNanchor_319" id="FNanchor_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> Fulk came to visit Robert in Normandy,
where he found him convalescing after a serious illness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
and revealed to him his passion for Bertrada de Montfort, niece
and ward of Robert’s vassal, William of Évreux. If the duke
would only gain for him the hand of the beautiful Bertrada, he,
Fulk, would keep the Manceaux in obedience. Accordingly, so
runs the account, Robert undertook the delicate negotiations for
this famous amour. But William of Évreux was far from pliable,
and not until the duke had made him enormous concessions<a name="FNanchor_320" id="FNanchor_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>
did he agree to the marriage of his ward to the notorious count of
Anjou. But with such sacrifices the hand of Bertrada was won,
and, true to his undertaking, Fulk prevented a revolt of the
Manceaux for a year, “rather by prayers and promises than by
force.”</p>

<p>In the year 1090, Robert by this time having become still more
deeply involved in his struggle with William Rufus, new and far
more serious troubles broke out in Maine.<a name="FNanchor_321" id="FNanchor_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> Helias of La Flèche,
grandson of Herbert Éveille-Chien through his daughter Paula,
set up a claim to the county, and in furtherance of his ambition
seized the castle of Ballon, which Duke Robert had besieged and
taken two years before. Within the city of Le Mans, however, the
cause of Helias made little progress, thanks mainly to Bishop
Hoël, who remained staunchly loyal to Robert Curthose and used
his great influence to keep the citizens true to their allegiance.<a name="FNanchor_322" id="FNanchor_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>
But when Helias perceived that the bishop was the chief obstacle
to his plan of throwing off the Norman yoke, he did not scruple to
seize him and hold him in captivity at La Flèche amid circumstances
of great indignity. He could hardly have made a greater
mistake. So great was Hoël’s popularity that the persecution
provoked a remarkable popular demonstration in his favor.
Within the city and the suburbs of Le Mans holy images and
crosses were laid flat upon the ground, church doors were blockaded
with brambles in sign of mourning, bells ceased to ring,
and all the customary religious services and solemnities were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
suspended. Before such a demonstration Helias yielded and set
the bishop free.<a name="FNanchor_323" id="FNanchor_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, Geoffrey of Mayenne and other revolutionaries had
brought from Italy a third claimant to the county of Maine in the
person of Hugh of Este, another grandson of Herbert Éveille-Chien.<a name="FNanchor_324" id="FNanchor_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>
And with his arrival, the rebellion made more rapid
progress. Helias of La Flèche, forgetful for the moment of his
own claims, joined with Geoffrey of Mayenne and other prominent
Manceaux in welcoming the new count. Oaths of fealty to
Robert Curthose weighed for nothing.<a name="FNanchor_325" id="FNanchor_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p>But Bishop Hoël stood firmly against the revolution. His
loyalty could not be shaken. Withdrawing from Le Mans, he
hastened to Normandy and laid the whole state of affairs before
the duke. But Robert was “sunk in sloth and given over to the
pursuit of pleasure,” and showed himself little worthy of the
bishop’s loyalty and devotion. The rebellion in Maine disturbed
him little; and he showed no disposition to act with vigor for its
suppression. It was enough, he thought, if he could preserve his
right of patronage over the bishopric. He directed the bishop at
all costs to avoid making any concessions to the rebels in the matter
of patronage, and with no better satisfaction sent him away.<a name="FNanchor_326" id="FNanchor_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>
Returning to Le Mans, Hoël found Hugh in possession of the city
and occupying the episcopal palace. Hugh opened negotiations
and tried to persuade the bishop to receive the temporalities of
his office as a grant from himself; but Hoël remained true to
Duke Robert, and would make no concessions. An agreement
proved impossible. Meanwhile Hugh had succeeded in stirring up
a formidable faction against the bishop among the clergy. Soon
the disorders became so aggravated that Hoël was obliged to
retire from his diocese and seek asylum in England, where he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
received a cordial welcome from William Rufus and remained for
some four months.<a name="FNanchor_327" id="FNanchor_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> But in the spring of the following year
(1091) he returned to his diocese, and, after further controversy,
was finally reconciled with Hugh and his enemies among the
clergy, and welcomed back to Le Mans amid much ceremony
and rejoicing (29-30 June).<a name="FNanchor_328" id="FNanchor_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> Apparently he had at last come
to regard Duke Robert and his rights with complete indifference.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>But by this time the popularity of Count Hugh had vanished
among the Manceaux, who had found him to be “without wealth,
sense, or valor.”<a name="FNanchor_329" id="FNanchor_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> And when the soft Italian learned that
Robert Curthose and William Rufus had composed their difficulties
and, as allies, were planning the reëstablishment of Norman
rule in Maine,<a name="FNanchor_330" id="FNanchor_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> he had no stomach for remaining longer to
cope with the difficulties that were gathering around him. A few
days after he had made peace with Bishop Hoël, he sold all his
rights in Maine to Helias of La Flèche for 10,000 <i>sous manceaux</i>,
and departed for Italy.<a name="FNanchor_331" id="FNanchor_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> Count Helias now quickly gained the
recognition and support of Hoël and of Fulk le Réchin,<a name="FNanchor_332" id="FNanchor_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> and
became henceforth the sole opponent of Norman rights in Maine.
Hard fighting was yet in store for him against William Rufus, and
only in the time of Henry I was he to obtain universal recognition;
but for the time being his trials were at an end. The plans
which William and Robert were maturing for a combined invasion
of the county were, as has been seen,<a name="FNanchor_333" id="FNanchor_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> suspended by their sudden
departure for England in August 1091. And when Robert returned
to the Continent, he made, so far as is known, no effort to
recover his authority in Maine. Through weakness and inertia he
had allowed a splendid territory, which the Conqueror had been
at much pains to win, to slip from his hands without striking a
blow. Indeed, without any formal abrogation of his rights he
seems to have dropped all pretension to ruling in Maine. In four
extant charters he bears the title of count or prince of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
Manceaux.<a name="FNanchor_334" id="FNanchor_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> But they all belong to the early period of his reign
(1087-91), and, so far as their evidence goes, it is not clear that he
used the title after 1089.</p>

<p>It was not only in his dealings with William Rufus and in his
government of Maine that Robert’s reign was one long record of
weakness and failure. He showed himself equally incompetent to
curb and control the feudal baronage within the duchy. We have
already remarked the general expulsion of royal garrisons from
baronial castles upon the death of the Conqueror.<a name="FNanchor_335" id="FNanchor_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> It is not
recorded that Robert made any protest against this, and his own
reckless grants of castles to the barons aggravated a situation
which had been dangerous from the first. He gave Ivry to William
of Breteuil; and for recompense to Roger of Beaumont, who
had previously had castle guard at Ivry, he gave Brionne, “a most
powerful fortress in the very heart of his duchy.”<a name="FNanchor_336" id="FNanchor_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> To William
of Breteuil, he also gave Pont-Saint-Pierre, and to William of
Évreux, Bavent, Noyon, Gacé, and Gravençon, apparently for no
better reason than to gratify Fulk le Réchin in the matter of
Bertrada de Montfort and gain his friendly support in Maine.<a name="FNanchor_337" id="FNanchor_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>
When Robert had reduced Saint-Céneri by a successful siege, he
immediately gave it away to Robert Géré,<a name="FNanchor_338" id="FNanchor_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> upon whom he later
had to make war to compel the destruction of an adulterine
castle.<a name="FNanchor_339" id="FNanchor_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> He established Gilbert of Laigle at Exmes,<a name="FNanchor_340" id="FNanchor_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> and to
Helias of Saint-Saëns he granted several strongholds on the east
bank of the Seine.<a name="FNanchor_341" id="FNanchor_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> The almost independent establishment of
Prince Henry in the Cotentin and the Avranchin has been noted
elsewhere. Some of these favored barons, it is true, remained
faithful to their trusts; but such reckless prodigality meant exhaustion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
of resources, and too often it meant license for private
war, plunder of the unarmed populace, and an open defiance of
ducal authority.</p>

<p>Against rebellious barons, the duke could on occasion act with
great vigor. In 1088 he threw Robert of Bellême into prison,<a name="FNanchor_342" id="FNanchor_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>
and accepted the challenge of Roger of Montgomery to a decisive
contest. He laid siege to the impregnable stronghold of Saint-Céneri,
and when he had reduced it by starvation, he blinded
Robert Quarrel, the castellan, and had other members of the garrison
condemned to mutilation by judgment of his <i>curia</i>.<a name="FNanchor_343" id="FNanchor_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> He
also imprisoned Robert of Meulan for factious opposition to the
grant of Ivry to William of Breteuil; and, in the sequel of this
controversy, between three in the afternoon and sunset, he took
Brionne by assault, a great fortress which it had taken the Conqueror
three years to reduce with the aid of the king of France.<a name="FNanchor_344" id="FNanchor_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p>But with all this fitful energy, the duke’s love of ease and his
desire ‘to sleep under a roof’ called him home too often in mid-campaign.<a name="FNanchor_345" id="FNanchor_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>
He lacked the resolution to carry a difficult and
laborious enterprise through to the end. Seeking mere temporary
advantages, he was prone to adopt the easy but fatal expedient of
allying himself with the turbulent barons whose lawlessness it
should have been his first concern to curb. Upon the fall of
Saint-Céneri he seemed to be in mid-course of victory over the
notorious house of Talvas. The shocking punishment visited
upon the surrendered garrison had caused fear and consternation
to spread among the supporters of Roger of Montgomery. The
garrisons of Bellême and Alençon are said to have been ready to
surrender at the mere approach of the ducal forces. Yet to the
general amazement the war went no further. The duke suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
made peace with Roger and released Robert of Bellême from
captivity.<a name="FNanchor_346" id="FNanchor_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<p>And the peace then made with the rebel was a lasting one.
Not again, until after his return from the Crusade, did the duke
fight against Robert of Bellême. Evidently he had decided that
in his future difficulties it would be better to have the house of
Talvas for him rather than against him. Not a check was placed
hereafter by the duke upon this most notorious tyrant of the age.
Robert of Bellême was “a subtle genius, crafty and deceitful.”
His ability challenged admiration. But his cruelty, avarice, and
lawlessness knew no bounds. Plundering and oppressing all over
whom he had power, he came to be regarded by contemporaries as
the veritable incarnation of Satan.<a name="FNanchor_347" id="FNanchor_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> He built a castle in a
dominating position at Fourches, and forcibly transferred the
inhabitants of Vignats thither. He also erected Château-Gontier
in a strong position on the Orne, and thus placed his yoke upon
the district of Le Houlme.<a name="FNanchor_348" id="FNanchor_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> Against Geoffrey of Mortagne he
waged a war for the possession of Domfront.<a name="FNanchor_349" id="FNanchor_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> He did not hesitate
to besiege Gilbert of Laigle, the duke’s loyal vassal, at
Exmes.<a name="FNanchor_350" id="FNanchor_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> His intolerable violence drew down upon him a concerted
attack by his neighbors in the Hiémois. But he was able
to bring the duke to his aid and to besiege his enemies at Courcy,
in January 1091.<a name="FNanchor_351" id="FNanchor_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> Later he waged a successful war against
Robert Géré of Saint-Céneri and a formidable combination of the
lords of Maine. Again on this occasion he gained the assistance
of the duke, and so compelled the destruction of a castle which
Géré was attempting to fortify at Montaigu.<a name="FNanchor_352" id="FNanchor_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> He was said to be
the possessor of thirty-four strong castles,<a name="FNanchor_353" id="FNanchor_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> and he was, perhaps,
more powerful than the duke himself. Indeed, in his dealings
with the duke the relation of lord and vassal seems at times
almost to have been inverted, as when Robert Curthose acted as
his ally in private warfare.</p>

<p>One might perhaps suppose that considerations of policy led
the duke to adopt a conciliatory attitude towards Robert of Bellême,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
his most powerful subject. But in his dealings with other
barons Robert showed himself equally weak and vacillating. He
made no effort to check the long and desperate war by which
William of Breteuil was seeking to bring his rebellious vassal,
Ascelin Goël, back to his allegiance.<a name="FNanchor_354" id="FNanchor_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> Indeed, he sought rather
to gain some temporary financial advantage from it. When
Ascelin, in defiance of feudal right and honor, seized Ivry, the
castle of his lord, Robert did not scruple to take it from him and
to compel William of Breteuil to redeem it by a payment of 1500
livres.<a name="FNanchor_355" id="FNanchor_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> And a little later he took the other side in the struggle,
and, in exchange for ‘large sums’ joined with Robert of Bellême,
King Philip of France, and other hirelings whom William of Breteuil
was gathering from every quarter, in the overthrow of
Ascelin at the siege of Bréval.<a name="FNanchor_356" id="FNanchor_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> When a bitter feud broke out
between William of Évreux and Ralph of Conches, Robert sought
to avoid becoming involved in the struggle. But his failure to
respond to the appeal of the lord of Conches merely drove the
latter into the arms of William Rufus.<a name="FNanchor_357" id="FNanchor_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>

<p>The expulsion of Prince Henry from the Cotentin and the
Avranchin after the siege of Mont-Saint-Michel had been no
lasting victory for the duke. In 1092 Henry suddenly reappeared
in western Normandy in secure possession of the town and
castle of Domfront. The inhabitants had revolted against the
intolerable oppression of Robert of Bellême, and, recalling Henry
from exile, had accepted him as their lord.<a name="FNanchor_358" id="FNanchor_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> Secure in the possession
of this impregnable stronghold, Henry set himself to
recover the lands from which he had been expelled and to establish
himself in an independent position in the southwest. He
defied Robert of Bellême,<a name="FNanchor_359" id="FNanchor_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> and made war upon the duke with
much burning, pillage, and violence.<a name="FNanchor_360" id="FNanchor_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> With the aid of Earl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
Hugh of Chester, to whom he gave the castle of Saint-James,
and of Richard de Redvers, Roger de Mandeville, and others, he
gradually won back the greater part of the Cotentin.<a name="FNanchor_361" id="FNanchor_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<p>The pages of Ordericus Vitalis are filled with lamentations over
the evil times that had fallen upon the duchy. Through the
indolence of a soft and careless duke all that the Conqueror had
created by his vigor and ability was allowed to fall into decay and
confusion. The whole province was in a state of dissolution.
Bands of freebooters overran villages and country, and plundered
the unarmed peasantry. The church’s possessions were wrung
from her by force. Monasteries were filled with desolation, and
the monks and nuns were reduced to penury. Adulterine castles
arose on every hand to become the dens of robbers who ravaged
the countryside with fire and sword. A depopulated country
remained for years afterwards a silent witness to the evil day.<a name="FNanchor_362" id="FNanchor_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

<p>That the indignant outbursts of Ordericus Vitalis are not mere
rhetoric, is amply proved by a more prosaic narrative of the nuns
of La Trinité of Caen.<a name="FNanchor_363" id="FNanchor_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> In the cartulary of their abbey they
have tersely recorded the long list of their injuries and losses in
men and revenues and lands and cattle. “After the death of
King William,” they say, “William, count of Évreux, took from
Holy Trinity and from the abbess and the nuns seven arpents of
vineyard and two horses and twenty sous of the coinage of Rouen
and the salt pans at Écrammeville and twenty livres annually
from Gacé and from Bavent. Richard, son of Herluin, took the
two manors of Tassilly and Montbouin. William the chamberlain,
son of Roger de Candos, took the tithe of Hainovilla. William
Baivel took twenty oxen which he had seized at Auberville.
Robert de Bonebos plundered the same manor …;” and so the
complaint continues through a long list of some thirty offenders,
among them such well known names as Richard de Courcy,
William Bertran, and Robert Mowbray. Even Prince Henry
takes his place in this remarkable catalogue of sinners. It is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
little startling to learn that in his government of the Cotentin he
was not altogether worthy of the polite compliments which have
been paid him by the chroniclers. The nuns complain that he
“took toll (<i>pedagium</i>) from Quettehou and from all the Cotentin,
and forced the men of Holy Trinity in the said vill and county to
work upon the castles of his men.” It is significant that in this
extraordinary entry in the Caen cartulary the record of violations
of right stands alone. We hear nothing of suits for the recovery
of the alienated lands and goods. The distressed nuns appear to
have been patiently preserving the record of their grievances
against the day when there should be a government and courts
to which they could appeal with some prospect of obtaining
redress.</p>

<p>Indeed, orderly government and the regular operation of courts
of law seem to have been suspended almost entirely during
Robert’s reign. With the exception of a fragment of a charter of
donation in favor of Saint-Vincent of Le Mans,<a name="FNanchor_364" id="FNanchor_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> no single record
of an administrative or judicial act by the duke for Maine has
been preserved. And for Normandy we have nothing but a few
scattered references to the <i>curia ducis</i><a name="FNanchor_365" id="FNanchor_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> and one imperfect record
of a suit before that court in 1093.<a name="FNanchor_366" id="FNanchor_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> The study of Robert’s
charters, which have now at last been collected and set in order,<a name="FNanchor_367" id="FNanchor_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[197]</a>
reveals a state of disorder and of irregularity hardly conceivable
so soon after the reign of the Conqueror. The duke had a chancellor
and evidently some semblance of a centralized administration.
Yet the chancery seems hardly ever to have performed the
most common functions of such an office, viz., the issuing of ducal
charters. Most of Robert’s acts were drawn up locally and according
to the prevailing forms of the religious houses in whose
favor they were issued. Evidence of any systematic taxation is
wholly lacking; and the extent to which Robert was neglectful
of ducal customs and rights of justice stands patently revealed by
the inquest of Caen, held when, for a moment, with the assistance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
of William Rufus, a more vigorous régime was in contemplation.<a name="FNanchor_368" id="FNanchor_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>
Rare occasions when the duke asserted himself to compel
the destruction of an adulterine castle<a name="FNanchor_369" id="FNanchor_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> or the submission of a
refractory noble stand out as wholly exceptional in a reign of
weakness, indifference, and indecision.<a name="FNanchor_370" id="FNanchor_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>

<p>It was, of course, the clergy who suffered most from this reign
of lawlessness and who were at the same time able to make their
woes articulate. The lamentful narrative of Ordericus Vitalis
and the bare record of the nuns of Caen have already been
sufficiently dwelt upon. Yet it should in justice be noted that
Robert Curthose was not a wilful oppressor of the church. He
was no impious tyrant such as William Rufus or Ranulf Flambard.
His offences against the clergy were rather the sins of
weakness than of malice. His sale of lay rights over the sees of
Coutances and Avranches to Prince Henry<a name="FNanchor_371" id="FNanchor_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> when he was preparing
for the invasion of England was doubtless dictated by the
sudden needs of the moment. So, too, in 1089 he granted the
manor of Gisors, a property of the church of St. Mary of Rouen,
to his overlord, King Philip, “non habens de proprio quod posset
dare.”<a name="FNanchor_372" id="FNanchor_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> On the other hand, the duke often acted in a perfectly
just and cordial coöperation with the clergy. There is every
indication of harmony in the relations between Robert and the
bishops and abbots at the synod held at Rouen in June 1091, for
the election of Serlo as bishop of Séez.<a name="FNanchor_373" id="FNanchor_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> So, too, soon after, he
gave his willing assent to the election of Roger du Sap as abbot
of Saint-Évroul, and “committed to him by the pastoral staff the
care of the monastery in worldly affairs.”<a name="FNanchor_374" id="FNanchor_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> So, also, upon the
election of Anselm, abbot of Bec, as archbishop of Canterbury, he
gladly consented to his resignation of the abbey,<a name="FNanchor_375" id="FNanchor_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> and afterwards
entirely accommodated himself to Anselm’s wishes with
regard to his successor at Bec. There is a note of real affection in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
the words with which Anselm in a letter to the prior and monks of
Bec refers to Robert on this occasion: “By the grace of God, our
lord the prince of the Normans has sent me a most kindly letter
asking pardon if his love of me and his sorrow at my loss have
caused him to think or say of me anything unseemly because of
my election to the archiepiscopate. In the same letter he has
graciously sought my counsel concerning the appointment of an
abbot for you, and has promised to accept it gladly not only in
this matter but in other things as well.”<a name="FNanchor_376" id="FNanchor_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p>

<p>Of the duke’s relations with the papacy in this period we know
almost nothing, except that his attitude, on the whole, was one
of obedience and accommodation. The violence which Robert
had done to the property of St. Mary of Rouen in granting the
manor of Gisors to King Philip caused Archbishop William to lay
the whole province under an interdict. This, in turn, brought on
a controversy between the archbishop and the abbey of Fécamp,
and in the sequel the Pope suspended the metropolitan from the
use of his pallium for having exceeded his authority. At this
point the duke intervened, and at the expense of acknowledging
himself subject to the jurisdiction of the apostolic see, “saving
only the privileges of his ancestors,” he obtained for the archbishop
at least a temporary restoration of his pallium, while
further investigations were pending.<a name="FNanchor_377" id="FNanchor_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> The church and clergy
often suffered from Robert’s weakness, or his sudden temptation
to gain some temporary advantage, but rarely, if ever, from his
ill will.</p>

<p>Inexcusable weakness and the steady disintegration of ducal
authority, either through his own rash grants, or through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
usurpations of his turbulent subjects, or through the insidious
aggressions of William Rufus, these are the outstanding features
of Duke Robert’s unfortunate reign.</p>

<p>Two days before Christmas, 1091, Robert had departed from
England and returned to Normandy, feeling much vexed because
the Red King would not abide by the terms of their alliance.<a name="FNanchor_378" id="FNanchor_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>
Yet an open breach between the brothers was long delayed. William
Rufus had his hands full with domestic affairs in 1092 and
1093, and he had little opportunity either for advancing his own
interests in Normandy or for aiding the duke against his enemies
as he had agreed to do. Robert, on his part, so far as can be seen,
did not fail in his obligations under the provisions of the treaty.
In the reservation which he attached to a grant to the abbey of
Bec in February 1092 he was careful to guard the rights of William
Rufus as well as of himself.<a name="FNanchor_379" id="FNanchor_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> The readiness with which he
accommodated himself to the king’s wishes in releasing Anselm,
abbot of Bec, to become archbishop of Canterbury in 1093 is indicative
of a similar spirit of coöperation. But it appears that he
sought in vain the king’s promised assistance in Normandy until
his patience was exhausted; and when, finally, the rupture came
between them, it was the duke who took the initiative in terminating
an agreement from which he could no longer hope to derive
any good. Towards the close of 1093, he addressed to William
Rufus a formal defiance. “This year at Christmas,” says the
Chronicler, “King William held his court at Gloucester; and
there came messengers to him out of Normandy, from his brother
Robert, and they said that his brother renounced all peace and
compact if the king would not perform all that they had stipulated
in the treaty; moreover they called him perjured and
faithless unless he would perform the conditions, or would go to
the place where the treaty had been concluded and sworn to, and
there clear himself.”<a name="FNanchor_380" id="FNanchor_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>In the spring of 1094, William Rufus took up this challenge and
prepared for an invasion of Normandy. It is characteristic of the
Red King that we hear more of the vast quantities of money
which he gathered in from all sides than of the men whom he
brought together for the expedition. The barons were called upon
to contribute heavily to the expenses of the campaign, and strong
pressure was put upon them in order to insure that their offerings
should not be too sparing. Archbishop Anselm thought to make
a contribution of five hundred pounds of silver, but the king rejected
his offer as being too small.<a name="FNanchor_381" id="FNanchor_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> On 2 February the forces
were assembled at Hastings for the crossing.<a name="FNanchor_382" id="FNanchor_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> But the winds
were contrary and the expedition was delayed for more than a
month,<a name="FNanchor_383" id="FNanchor_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> and it did not succeed in sailing till Midlent.<a name="FNanchor_384" id="FNanchor_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<p>After the landing in Normandy, active hostilities were still
further delayed by negotiations. William and Robert met in a
conference, but a reconciliation proved impossible between them.
Then a more formal meeting was held at an unidentified place
called <i>Campus Martius</i>, and the dispute was laid before the great
nobles who had confirmed the earlier treaty with their oaths.
Unanimously they gave their decision in favor of the duke and
laid the whole responsibility for the present discord upon the
king. But William Rufus, ‘a fierce king,’ would have none of
their condemnation. He would not accept responsibility for the
breach, neither would he abide by the terms of the treaty. The
conference was accordingly broken off, and the brothers separated
in wrath, the king going to his headquarters at Eu, the duke to
Rouen.<a name="FNanchor_385" id="FNanchor_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, or more likely even before this, William Rufus turned to
that brand of diplomacy in which he was so eminently skilful and
which had gained him such successes in his earlier Norman policy.
With the treasure which he had brought from England, he began
to collect great numbers of mercenaries; and also, by lavish expenditure
of gold and silver, and by grants and promises of Norman
lands, he succeeded in corrupting more of the Norman
baronage and in winning them away from their allegiance to the
duke. And as rapidly as he gained possession of their strongholds
he filled them with garrisons upon whom he could rely.<a name="FNanchor_386" id="FNanchor_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> But he
was not content with mere diplomacy and bribery. He also took
the field, and laying siege to Bures, a castle of Helias of Saint-Saëns,
he reduced it, and took many of the duke’s men captive.<a name="FNanchor_387" id="FNanchor_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<p>But meanwhile, Robert had not been idle, and the success of
his operations suggests that he had not ventured to defy William
Rufus without making greater preparations than have been
recorded by the contemporary writers. As he had done previously
when confronted with an English invasion, he brought in his overlord,
King Philip, and a French army.<a name="FNanchor_388" id="FNanchor_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> Philip and Robert appear
to have opened their campaign in the south and west of
Normandy with two remarkable victories. Philip invested Argentan,<a name="FNanchor_389" id="FNanchor_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>
and, on the very first day of the siege, Roger le Poitevin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
and an enormous garrison of seven hundred knights and fourteen
hundred esquires surrendered without any blood being shed, and
were held by the king to ransom. Soon after, the duke won a
victory of almost equal importance by the reduction of Le
Homme and the capture of William Peverel and a garrison of
eight hundred knights.<a name="FNanchor_390" id="FNanchor_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></p>

<p>These reverses came as a staggering surprise to William Rufus.
Immediately he sent off to England and ordered the assembling
of a great army of English foot soldiers—some twenty thousand,
it is said—for the invasion of Normandy. But when they
came to Hastings for the crossing, Ranulf Flambard, at the king’s
order, took from each of them the ten shillings that he had
brought for maintenance during the campaign; and then sent
them back home, while he forwarded the money to William
Rufus in Normandy.<a name="FNanchor_391" id="FNanchor_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> The king had need of this fresh supply of
English treasure. For by this time Philip and Robert, after their
double victory in the south and west, were advancing on William’s
headquarters at Eu,<a name="FNanchor_392" id="FNanchor_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> in the very heart of the district which he
had controlled since 1089 or 1090. But at Longueville King
Philip halted.<a name="FNanchor_393" id="FNanchor_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> William Rufus had found a way to repeat the
measure which had turned the French king back from La Ferté in
1089, if not from Eu in 1091. “There was the king of France
turned back by craft, and all the expedition was afterwards dispersed.”<a name="FNanchor_394" id="FNanchor_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>
Again the resources of Duke Robert had proved unequal
to the greater stores of English treasure which the Red King
was able to command.<a name="FNanchor_395" id="FNanchor_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet the strength of Robert’s resistance was by no means
broken. William Rufus sent to Domfront to call Prince Henry
to his aid, and such was Robert’s strength that it proved impossible
for Henry to make his way by land to Eu. The king sent
ships to fetch him.<a name="FNanchor_396" id="FNanchor_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> But instead of proceeding to Eu, he
crossed the Channel, and, landing at Southampton at the end of
October, he went to London for Christmas, evidently with a view
to meeting the king upon his return from the Continent.<a name="FNanchor_397" id="FNanchor_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>
Meanwhile, William Rufus remained in Normandy almost to the
end of the year. But clearly he met with no great success in his
projects. He had spent vast sums of money, yet little or nothing
had come of it—so ran the contemporary judgment: “Infecto
itaque negotio, in Angliam reversus est.”<a name="FNanchor_398" id="FNanchor_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> On 29 December he
crossed from Wissant to Dover.<a name="FNanchor_399" id="FNanchor_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

<p>The progress of the Norman war in 1095 is obscure in the extreme.
The king’s whole attention was absorbed by pressing
affairs within the limits of his own realm; and he seems to have
committed his continental interests almost wholly to Prince
Henry. Henry remained in England until Lent, and then crossed
over to Normandy ‘with great treasure’; and during the months
which followed, he waged war against Duke Robert.<a name="FNanchor_400" id="FNanchor_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> But in
what part of the duchy, or how, or with what success, we have no
information.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>The close of the year 1095 saw Robert Curthose in a difficult
situation, but the issue of the contest had not yet been decided.
Meanwhile, the famous sermon of Pope Urban II before the
council of Clermont had thrilled all Europe with a new impulse
and turned the course of Robert’s life into a new and unexpected
channel.</p>

a contemporary narrative by a Durham writer, who was an eyewitness of the bishop’s
trial, represents him as the persecuted victim of malicious enemies who had
poisoned the king’s mind against him. <i>De Iniusta Vexatione Willelmi Episcopi
Primi</i>, in Simeon of Durham, <i>Opera Omnia</i>, ed. Thomas Arnold (London, 1882-85),
i, pp. 170-195. And it should be remembered that his condemnation by the

to acknowledge the jurisdiction of the court. On the treatise <i>De Iniusta Vexatione</i>

William of Malmesbury, he was released after a half-year’s detention. If we could
rely upon this statement, and couple it with the earlier statement of Ordericus that
the imprisonment began in the autumn of 1088, we could assign Henry’s release to
the late winter or spring following (1089).</p>

Robert Curthose and King Philip besieged La Ferté-en-Bray. Further, the siege

William Rufus dated a charter at Dover 27 January 1091, probably soon before
sailing for Normandy. Davis, <i>Regesta</i>, no. 315. The dating clause of this charter,
“anno Dominicae incarnationis mill. xc, regni vero mei iiii, indictione xiii, vi kal.
Feb., luna iii,” is not consistent throughout; but the year of the reign and of the
lunation both compel us to assign it to 1091. Moreover, Ralph, bishop of Chichester,
and Herbert, bishop of Thetford, both of whom attest, were not raised to their
sees till 1091. Cf. Freeman, <i>William Rufus</i>, ii, pp. 484-485. Ralph appears to have
been consecrated 6 January 1091. Stubbs, <i>Registrum Sacrum Anglicanum</i>.</p>

Francorum.” It is a plausible hypothesis that William of Saint-Calais, the exiled
bishop of Durham, played a part in these peace negotiations. Upon his expulsion
from England, between 27 November 1088 and 3 January 1089, he went to Normandy
and was received by Duke Robert “rather as a father than as an exile”
(Simeon, <i>H. D. E.</i>, p. 128) and had the administration of the duchy committed to his
charge (<i>De Iniusta Vexatione</i>, in Simeon, <i>Opera</i>, i, p. 194); and he remained in Normandy
and enjoyed a position of honor for three years. In 1089 he attested two
of Duke Robert’s charters (Davis, <i>Regesta</i>, nos. 308, 310), and he also attested with
the duke a charter by Hugh Painel [1089-91] (Haskins, p. 69, no. 16). Then in the
third year of his expulsion, when the king’s men were being besieged in a ‘certain
castle in Normandy’ and were on the point of being taken, he saved them from
their peril, and by his counsel the siege was raised (Simeon, <i>H. D. E.</i>, p. 128. Can
this refer to the siege of Eu and to the pacification of February (?) 1091?) See Appendix
B, <i>infra</i>, p. 215 and n. 14.</p>

Vitalis (iii, p. 378) William and Robert, after they had made peace, besieged Henry
at Mont-Saint-Michel for two weeks in the middle of Lent—according to Florence
of Worcester (ii, p. 27), during the whole of Lent. The treaty, therefore, could
hardly have been concluded later than the end of February.</p>

The statement of the <i>Actus Pontificum</i> (<i>supra</i>, n. 137) is not convincing
because the next sentence opens with the rebellion of 1090. Robert of Torigny
shows himself poorly informed in these matters. The statement of Ordericus is
vague, and his record elsewhere does not point to any serious disturbances till later

September of that year. It is not so clear that it did not take place after 1088; yet
between this and the successful rebellion of 1090 there were the threatened disturbances

to Normandy with the king, who was evidently about to sail at the time the
Dover charter was issued.</p>

(1 June) at Solesmes; and arriving at La Couture 28 June, he observed the
day of the Apostles on the 29th; and the ceremony in the cathedral church took
place the day following. <i>Chartularium Insignis Ecclesiae Cenomanensis quod dicitur
Liber Albus Capituli</i> (Le Mans, 1869), no. 178; cf. <i>Cartulaire de S.-Vincent</i>, no. 117.
The year in which these events occurred requires some further discussion. Latouche,
though admitting with Ordericus Vitalis (iii, p. 327) that the revolt began
in 1090, still believes that Hugh did not arrive in Maine until after Easter 1091,
that Hoël was in England from November to March 1091-92, and that his return
and reconciliation with Hugh took place at the end of June 1092. <i>Maine</i>, pp. 41-44.
Latouche bases his chronological deductions upon a charter by Hugh in favor
of Marmoutier, given at Tours, according to Latouche, on 13 April 1091. Bibliothèque
Nationale MSS., Collection Baluze, 76, fol. 14. Since Hugh does not bear
the title of count in this document, Latouche argues that he had not yet arrived in
Maine, and, therefore, that the subsequent events of the revolution must be carried
forward through 1091 into 1092. The dating clause of the charter in question, as
kindly furnished me by M. Henri Omont, is as follows: “Factum hoc mᵒ anno et
lxxxxi. ab incarnatione Domini, indictione xiiii. anno xxxiiii. Philippi regis, primo
anno R. archiepiscopatus, secundi Aurelianensis. Aderbal scolae minister secundarius
scriptsit.” Granting that this is a document of the year 1091—which is
by no means likely, in view of the year of the reign and of Ralph, archbishop of
Tours—there still appears to be no reason why Latouche should assign it to the
Easter date (13 April); and upon other evidence it is clear that Hugh arrived in
Maine at a much earlier period: (1) It is not clear from the <i>Actus Pontificum</i> (pp.
386-387), as Latouche supposes (p. 42, n. 6), that Hoël was already in Normandy
upon Hugh’s arrival in Maine, but quite the contrary. (2) Ordericus Vitalis (iii,
pp. 328, 330) indicates that Hugh was induced to come to Maine because Robert
Curthose and William Rufus were at war, and that a strong argument in favor of his
return to Italy was the fact that they had recently made peace and were meditating
an attack upon Maine. This we know to have been in the spring and summer of
1091, and not in 1092 after William Rufus had returned to England. (3) A charter
by William Rufus proves the presence of Hoël in England 27 January 1091, and not
November-March 1091-92, as Latouche supposes. Davis, <i>Regesta</i>, no. 315.
(4) Finally, two charters in favor of Saint-Julien of Tours, dated 11 November
1091, prove that Helias was already at that time count of Maine with Hoël’s approval,
and incidentally show that Hoël was not then in England. <i>Charles de S.-Julien
de Tours</i>, nos. 43, 44.</p>

Henry of Huntingdon, p. 217. Florence of Worcester is the sole authority for
‘Campus Martius’ and for the fact that after the conferences Robert went to
Rouen and William Rufus to Eu. Henry of Huntingdon mentions only the final
meeting. A phrase in a letter of Bishop Ivo of Chartres makes it not improbable
that King Philip was present at this conference: “iturus vobiscum ad placitum
quod futurum est inter regem Anglorum et comitem Normannorum.” <i>H. F.</i>, xv,
p. 82, no. 28; cf. Fliche, <i>Philippe Iᵉʳ</i>, p. 299. But the letter is undated, and proof
is lacking that it refers to the conference of 1094. There is no basis for Fliche’s
assumption that the meeting between William and Robert took place at Pontoise
or at Chaumont-en-Vexin. Ivo’s letter contains no such evidence. The above
mentioned places are named only as a rendezvous for Philip and Ivo preparatory
to proceeding to the meeting between Robert and William.</p>

of Worcester (ii, p. 34), who seems generally best informed on these events,
has “Argentinum,” about which there can be no question. The readings of the
<i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i> (<i>a.</i> 1094) and of Henry of Huntingdon (p. 217) are “castel
aet Argentses” and “Argentes,” which might refer to Argentan or Argences.
Thomas Stapleton says that the place in question was Argentan. <i>Magni Rotuli

<p><a name="Footnote_395" id="Footnote_395"></a><a href="#FNanchor_395"><span class="label">[225]</span></a> Fliche sets forth the extraordinary hypothesis that there was no war between
William Rufus and Robert Curthose in 1094, though he admits the meeting between
them and the unsuccessful attempt at a reconciliation. He bases his hypothesis
upon the fact that Ordericus Vitalis makes no mention of the war of 1094, and
that the account of the campaign of 1094 as set forth in the English sources bears
certain resemblances to that of 1091. He argues that the English writers in their
confusion have assigned events to 1094 which really belong to 1091—in brief,
that there was only one campaign, that of 1091: “Et alors ne faudrait-il pas reporter
toute la campagne racontée ici à l’année 1090-1091?” <i>Philippe Iᵉʳ</i>, pp.
298-300. In point of fact there is far less duplication between the events of 1090-91
and 1094 than Fliche supposes, and such resemblances as exist are readily accounted
for by the fact that William Rufus had his headquarters at Eu on both occasions
and pursued the same general policy throughout his dealings with Robert
Curthose and King Philip. It may be admitted as extraordinary that the events
of 1094 have escaped the attention of Ordericus Vitalis; but to reject the highly
circumstantial accounts of the English writers is to betray a strange lack of appreciation
of the range and accuracy of their information.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="smaller">THE CRUSADE</span></h2>

<p>The year 1096 marks the beginning of a new era in the history of
western civilization as well as in the life of Robert Curthose. On
27 November 1095,<a name="FNanchor_401" id="FNanchor_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Pope Urban II had preached his momentous
sermon before the assembled multitude at Clermont, and ‘the
gates of the Latin world were opened’<a name="FNanchor_402" id="FNanchor_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> upon the East. “It was
the miracle of the Lord in our time,” writes Henry of Huntingdon,
“and a thing before unheard of in all the ages, that such divers
peoples and so many distinguished princes, leaving their splendid
possessions, their wives, and their children, set forth with one accord
and in scorn of death to seek the most unknown regions.”<a name="FNanchor_403" id="FNanchor_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>It was natural that the stirring words of Pope Urban should
find a ready hearing among the ‘untamed race of the Normans.’<a name="FNanchor_404" id="FNanchor_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
The great adventurers of their age, they were destined to play the
most vigorous and aggressive, if not the most devout and single-minded,
part in the supreme adventure of the Latin world in the
Middle Ages. Moreover, the situation of Duke Robert at home
was such that new fields of opportunity and adventure offered
peculiar attractions to him. Lacking the indomitable energy of
his great forbears and the Norman genius for organization,
government, and law, surrounded by enemies both within and
without his dominions, his tenure of the duchy had become a
heavy burden. His war with William Rufus still dragged on.
Disloyal barons continued to desert to the English cause; and
twenty Norman castles were said to be in the Red King’s hands.
Prince Henry, long firmly established at Domfront, and now
backed by the strong arm and the long purse of his older brother,
had gained control of ‘a great part of Normandy’; and the ‘soft<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
duke’ had fallen into contempt among his turbulent subjects.
Disobedience and disorder were everywhere on the increase, and
the unarmed population lacked a protector.<a name="FNanchor_405" id="FNanchor_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> An expedition to
the Holy Land at the head of a splendidly equipped band of
knights, with new scenes and new adventures and plenary indulgence
for past sins, offered a welcome prospect of escape from the
trying situation in which Duke Robert found himself in the spring
of 1096.<a name="FNanchor_406" id="FNanchor_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Yet the First Crusade was a papal, not a Norman, enterprise.<a name="FNanchor_407" id="FNanchor_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
At the provincial council of Rouen which was convened in February,
1096, for the purpose of ratifying the canons of the council of
Clermont, there is, oddly enough, no evidence that the projected
Crusade was taken under consideration by the Norman clergy.<a name="FNanchor_408" id="FNanchor_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
The initiative of the Pope, on the other hand, was clear-cut and
vigorous, and his activity can be traced with some fulness. From
Clermont Urban proceeded on a tour of western France; and
passing northward through Poitou and Anjou early in 1096, he
arrived at Le Mans in the middle of February and was at Vendôme
near the end of the month. Then turning back southward,
he was still occupied with the Crusade in a council at Tours in
March.<a name="FNanchor_409" id="FNanchor_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> The Pope seems not to have entered Normandy at all;
but he was close to the border while in Maine and at Vendôme,
and it is not improbable that it was during this period that he
took the first steps towards launching the Crusade in the Norman
lands.</p>

<p>Pope Urban’s first duty, if he wished to raise large forces in
Normandy for the Crusade, was obviously the promotion of peace
between the warring sons of William the Conqueror. It was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
to be thought of that Robert Curthose should lead a Norman
army to the liberation of the Holy Sepulchre while William Rufus
continued the struggle to deprive him of his duchy. Accordingly,
the Pope sent Abbot Gerento of Saint-Bénigne of Dijon as his
special agent to undertake the delicate task of negotiating a
peace.<a name="FNanchor_410" id="FNanchor_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> The abbot was with William Rufus in England at
Easter (13 April) 1096.<a name="FNanchor_411" id="FNanchor_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> He crossed to Normandy before the end
of May;<a name="FNanchor_412" id="FNanchor_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and remaining there throughout the summer, brought
the peace negotiations to a successful termination, and accompanied
the crusading host upon the initial stages of its journey as
it departed in the autumn.<a name="FNanchor_413" id="FNanchor_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> It may be conjectured that during
this whole period Gerento was engaged in the work of promoting
the Crusade in Normandy; and this conclusion is fully in accord
with the statements of the chroniclers that Duke Robert took the
cross “at the admonition of Pope Urban”<a name="FNanchor_414" id="FNanchor_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> and “by the counsel
of certain men of religion.”<a name="FNanchor_415" id="FNanchor_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>The treaty which had been concluded at the abbot’s instance
was wisely drawn to meet the exigencies of Robert’s situation.
Not only did it bring about the necessary peace, but upon such
terms as to provide the impecunious duke with ample funds for
his distant enterprise. Normandy was to be taken in pledge by
William Rufus, and in exchange Robert was to receive a loan of
10,000 marks of silver.<a name="FNanchor_416" id="FNanchor_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> The date at which this bargain was
struck cannot be exactly determined, but, in any case, it was early
enough to allow the king time to extort money from his unfortunate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
subjects by means which provoked a general outcry.<a name="FNanchor_417" id="FNanchor_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> An
aid (<i>auxilium</i>) was demanded of the barons, and an extraordinary
Danegeld was levied at the rate of four shillings to the hide
throughout the kingdom. Though the clergy had from early
times been exempted from this tax, their privileges were not now
respected; and they were obliged to pay their full share along
with the lay nobles.<a name="FNanchor_418" id="FNanchor_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Churches were stripped of their ornaments
in order that the sum might be raised.<a name="FNanchor_419" id="FNanchor_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, in Normandy and the surrounding lands, preparations
for the Crusade had been going steadily forward; though it
must be owned that we have but slight information concerning
the measures which were taken, beyond what may be inferred
from the occasional record of a mortgage of lands to a religious
house in exchange for a loan of ready cash for the journey,<a name="FNanchor_420" id="FNanchor_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> or
from the names of a relatively small number of men and women<a name="FNanchor_421" id="FNanchor_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>—less
than fifty in all—who, stirred by religious impulse, the
spirit of adventure, or the hope of gain, followed the duke’s
example and took the cross.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>So far as it is possible to describe it at this distance, Robert
Curthose certainly travelled at the head of an interesting and
honorable company, which, drawn not only from Normandy but
from the surrounding lands, was altogether worthy of the dignity
of the Conqueror’s eldest son. To attempt a comprehensive
enumeration would be tedious, but the names of at least the more
important of the duke’s companions should be recorded.<a name="FNanchor_422" id="FNanchor_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Of the
Norman bishops, the only ones who took the cross were Odo of
Bayeux and Gilbert of Évreux. Both had been present at the
council of Clermont as ‘legates’ of their fellow bishops; and
Odo, at any rate, had been in touch with Abbot Gerento in Normandy
during the summer of 1096. Yet it is doubtful whether he
was a very active promoter of the Crusade, for some, at least,
believed that he had taken the cross for personal reasons rather
than out of zeal for the Holy War. He had been driven from
England after the failure of the rebellion against William Rufus in
1088, and the king’s wrath against him had not been appeased.
Rather than remain in Normandy to become the subject of his
bitter enemy, he preferred to undertake the hardships of the distant
pilgrimage. Among the lay nobles from Normandy who
accompanied Robert on the Crusade we meet with no very great
names; but it is interesting to note that the list contains not only
such life-long friends of the duke as Ivo and Alberic of Grandmesnil,
but also—a fruit of the recent pacification—his late
enemies Count Stephen of Aumale and Gerard of Gournay. The
great house of Bellême was represented by Philip the Clerk, one
of its younger scions. Mention should also be made of Roger of
Barneville, an obscure knight from western Normandy, who was
destined to lose his life in a skirmish with the Turks at Antioch,
and whose noble character and unexampled bravery made him a
great favorite with the army.</p>

<p>The neighboring lands of northern France contributed an
equally distinguished company to Duke Robert’s forces. His
cousin, Count Robert of Flanders, and his less heroic brother-in-law,
Count Stephen of Blois and Chartres, both found it to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
their advantage to travel with him, as did also Alan Fergant,
duke of Brittany, and a notable list of Bretons. Among these
latter may be mentioned Alan, the steward of Archbishop Baldric
of Dol;<a name="FNanchor_423" id="FNanchor_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Ralph de Gael, the one-time earl of Norfolk whose treason
had caused the Conqueror to drive him forth from England;
Conan de Lamballe, who was killed by the Turks at Antioch; and
Riou de Lohéac, who died while on the Crusade, but sent back to
the church of his lordship a casket of precious relics which included
a portion of the true cross and a fragment of the Sepulchre.
From Perche came Rotrou of Mortagne, son of the then reigning
Count Geoffrey. And from the Flemish border came old Hugh,
count of Saint-Pol, and his brave son Enguerrand, who gave his
life for the Christian cause at Marra in Syria; Walter of Saint-Valery
and his valiant son Bernard, who according to one account
was the first to scale the wall of Jerusalem. The forces of Duke
Robert also included a number of Manceaux,<a name="FNanchor_424" id="FNanchor_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> but Helias of La
Flèche, the count of Maine, was not among them. Stirred by the
common impulse, he had taken the cross, apparently designing to
travel with Robert Curthose. But when he learned that William
Rufus would grant him no peace, but proposed to bring Maine
back under Norman domination by force of arms, he was obliged
to abandon his undertaking and remain at home to defend his
county.<a name="FNanchor_425" id="FNanchor_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>From England, strangely enough, only two crusaders of known
name and history have come to light among the followers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
Robert Curthose: the Norman William de Percy, the great benefactor
of Whitby abbey, and Arnulf of Hesdin, a Fleming.
Neither, it will be observed, was a native Englishman. The
Anglo-Saxon chronicler remarks that the preaching of Pope Urban
caused “a great excitement through all this nation,”<a name="FNanchor_426" id="FNanchor_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> and English
mariners are known to have coöperated with the crusaders on
the Syrian coast.<a name="FNanchor_427" id="FNanchor_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Yet England still lay largely beyond the range
of continental affairs and the great movements of world history,
and the part played by the English in the First Crusade appears
to have been of minor importance. William of Malmesbury
observes truly that ‘but a faint murmur of Asiatic affairs reached
the ears of those who dwelt beyond the British Ocean.’<a name="FNanchor_428" id="FNanchor_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>The standard-bearer of Duke Robert throughout the Crusade
is said to have been Pain Peverel, the distinguished Norman
knight who later was granted a barony in England by Henry I
and became the patron of Barnwell priory. As his chaplain, or
chancellor, Robert took Arnulf of Chocques, the clever Flemish
adventurer who had long served in the ducal family as preceptor
of his eldest sister, Princess Cecilia, and who later rose to the
dignity of patriarch of Jerusalem.<a name="FNanchor_429" id="FNanchor_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> And finally mention should
be made of Fulcher of Chartres, the well known historian of the
Crusade, who travelled with the ducal forces as far as Marash in
Armenia, and who up to that point may almost be regarded as the
official historiographer of the northern Norman contingent.</p>

<p>While preparations for the Crusade were being pushed forward
in Normandy and the adjoining lands, William Rufus had completed
the work of collecting English treasure for the Norman
loan, and in September 1096<a name="FNanchor_430" id="FNanchor_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> he crossed the Channel. Meeting
the duke, apparently at Rouen,<a name="FNanchor_431" id="FNanchor_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> he paid over the 10,000 marks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
which had been agreed upon, and received the duchy in pledge.<a name="FNanchor_432" id="FNanchor_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
Thus was Robert supplied with funds for his distant journey, and
when this most necessary matter had been arranged, final preparations
were speedily brought to an end, and the duke took his place
at the head of his forces.</p>

<p>Near the end of September, or early in October,<a name="FNanchor_433" id="FNanchor_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> amid tearful
but courageous leave-takings from friends and loved ones,<a name="FNanchor_434" id="FNanchor_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> the
crusaders set forth upon their long pilgrimage. As they moved
forward over the first stages of the march, their numbers were
considerably augmented by additional forces which flowed in
from districts along the way.<a name="FNanchor_435" id="FNanchor_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> At Pontarlier on the upper
waters of the Doubs, Abbot Gerento of Dijon and his faithful
secretary, Hugh of Flavigny, who had accompanied the host
thus far, and must have viewed with much satisfaction the successful
culmination of their enterprise, took their leave of the
leaders and turned back.<a name="FNanchor_436" id="FNanchor_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>From Pontarlier the route probably lay by the well known
road of pilgrimage and commerce past the great monastery of
Saint-Maurice and over the Alps by the Great St. Bernard to
Aosta, and thence across the valley of the Po and over the
Apennines to Lucca.<a name="FNanchor_437" id="FNanchor_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> At Lucca the crusaders were met by
Urban II, who conferred with the leaders, Robert of Normandy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
and Stephen of Blois, and gave his blessing to the departing host
as it moved on southward and came to Rome ‘rejoicing.’<a name="FNanchor_438" id="FNanchor_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> But
in the basilica of St. Peter the crusaders found little joy, for the
great church, with the exception of a single tower, was in the
hands of the men of the anti-Pope, who, sword in hand, seized the
offerings of the faithful from off the altar, and from the roof
hurled down stones upon the pilgrims as they prostrated themselves
in prayer.<a name="FNanchor_439" id="FNanchor_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Saddened by such outrages, but not delaying
to avenge them, they pushed on southward, pausing at Monte
Cassino to ask a blessing of St. Benedict as they passed,<a name="FNanchor_440" id="FNanchor_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> and
came to the port of Bari.<a name="FNanchor_441" id="FNanchor_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>Already tidings of the great enterprise which Pope Urban had
launched had stirred one of the ablest chiefs of the southern Normans
to action. Bohemond, prince of Taranto, the oldest son of
Robert Guiscard, was engaged in the siege of Amalfi with his
uncle, Count Roger of Sicily, when news reached him that early
contingents of French crusaders had already arrived in Italy.
The possibilities of the great adventure fired his ardent imagination,
and, “seized with a divine inspiration,” he took the cross.
Then, dramatically ordering his magnificent cloak to be cut into
crosses, he distributed them among such of the knights present as
were willing to follow his example; and so great was the rush of
men to his standard, that Count Roger found himself almost
deserted, and was obliged to abandon the siege and retire in
dudgeon to Sicily.<a name="FNanchor_442" id="FNanchor_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Before the arrival of Robert Curthose and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
the northern Normans, Bohemond had already crossed the
Adriatic at the head of a splendid band of knights and entered
upon the road to Constantinople.</p>

<p>The hopes of Robert and his followers to make an immediate
crossing and push on in the footsteps of Bohemond were doomed
to disappointment. When they arrived at Bari, winter was already
close at hand, and the Italian mariners were unwilling to
undertake the transport of such an army in the inclement season.<a name="FNanchor_443" id="FNanchor_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
Duke Robert and Count Stephen, therefore, were obliged
to turn aside and winter in Apulia and Calabria.<a name="FNanchor_444" id="FNanchor_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Only the more
active Robert of Flanders with his smaller forces managed to
make the winter passage and push on towards Constantinople.<a name="FNanchor_445" id="FNanchor_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
Meanwhile, Roger Bursa, duke of Apulia, received Robert of
Normandy with much honor “as his natural lord” and supplied
him with abundant provisions for himself and his noble associates.<a name="FNanchor_446" id="FNanchor_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
Many of the poorer crusaders, however, were confronted
with a grave problem. To winter peacefully in a friendly country
which they could not plunder seemed quite out of the question;
and, fearing lest they should fall into want, they sold their bows,
and, resuming pilgrims’ staves, turned back ‘ignominiously’ to
their northern homes.<a name="FNanchor_447" id="FNanchor_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> Their more fortunate comrades, the
nobles, however, found generous hospitality among friends;<a name="FNanchor_448" id="FNanchor_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
and the winter months must have passed pleasantly for these
northern Normans in the sunny Italian climate among their distinguished
kinsmen. Bishop Odo of Bayeux, still vigorous and
active, in spite of his advanced years, crossed over to Sicily, and
paid a visit to Count Roger’s beautiful capital at Palermo.
There he was taken with a fatal illness, and died early in 1097.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
His fellow bishop, Gilbert of Évreux, buried him in the great
cathedral church of St. Mary; and Count Roger reared a splendid
monument over his grave.<a name="FNanchor_449" id="FNanchor_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>With the return of spring, in the month of March, Robert of
Normandy and Stephen of Blois assembled their forces at Brindisi
and prepared to push on to Constantinople, the general
rendezvous of all the crusading armies. The embarkation was
marred by a tragic accident. One of the vessels broke up and
went to pieces almost within the harbor with some four hundred
souls on board, besides horses and mules and quantities of money.
Overwhelmed by fear in the presence of such a catastrophe, some
of the more faint-hearted landsmen abandoned the Crusade altogether
and turned back homeward, declaring that they would
never entrust themselves to the deceitful waves. Doubtless
more would have followed their example, had it not been discovered
that the bodies washed ashore after the wreck bore upon
their shoulders the miraculous imprint of the cross. Encouraged
by this token of divine favor, the crusaders place their trust in the
omnipotent God, and, raising sail on Easter morning (April 5)
amid the blare of many trumpets, pushed out to sea.<a name="FNanchor_450" id="FNanchor_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>Sailing before a gentle breeze, they made the passage without
further accident, and landed on the fourth day at two small
ports some ten miles distant from Durazzo. Thence, passing
Durazzo, they advanced along the ancient Roman road, the Via
Egnatia, with few adventures and by relatively rapid marches
towards Constantinople.<a name="FNanchor_451" id="FNanchor_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> The route lay up the valley of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
Skumbi and through a mountainous region to Ochrida, the ancient
capital of Bulgaria, and then on past Monastir and across the
Vardar to Salonica on the Aegean, a city ‘abounding in all good
things.’ There the crusaders pitched their tents and rested for
four days, and then pushed on by the coast road through Kavala
and Rodosto to Constantinople, where they encamped outside the
city and rested for a fortnight in the latter half of May.<a name="FNanchor_452" id="FNanchor_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>The magnificent oriental capital with its noble churches and
stately palaces, its broad streets filled with works of art, its
abounding wealth in gold and silver and rich hangings, its eunuchs,
and its busy merchants from beyond sea,<a name="FNanchor_453" id="FNanchor_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> made a deep
impression upon the minds of the crusaders, although they were
not permitted to view it at great advantage. For earlier bands
who had gone before them had not passed through the city without
plundering, and the Greeks had learned to be wary. The
Emperor Alexius ordered the crusaders to be well supplied with
markets outside the walls, but only in bands of five or six at a
time would he permit them to enter the city of wonders and pray
in the various churches.<a name="FNanchor_454" id="FNanchor_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, the leaders, Robert of Normandy and Stephen of
Blois, were being sumptuously entertained and assiduously
flattered by the Emperor.<a name="FNanchor_455" id="FNanchor_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> The real contest between him and
the crusading chieftains had already taken place and been practically
settled before the arrival of the northern Normans.<a name="FNanchor_456" id="FNanchor_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> After
the greater leaders, Godfrey of Bouillon and Bohemond, had
yielded to the Emperor’s demands and entered into treaty relations
with him, he had clearly gained his point, and it was not to
be supposed that he would meet with serious obstacles in dealing
with the princes who came later. Least of all were such difficulties
to be expected in Robert Curthose and Stephen of Blois.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
Both promptly took the oath that was required of them;<a name="FNanchor_457" id="FNanchor_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> for,
explains Fulcher of Chartres—evidently voicing a sentiment
which had become general—it was necessary for the crusaders to
consolidate their friendship with the Emperor, since without his
support and coöperation they could not advance freely through
his dominions, and it would be impossible for fresh recruits to
follow by the route which they had taken.</p>

<p>When Robert and Stephen had satisfied the demands of the
Emperor, he loaded them with gifts of money and silks and
horses, and, providing ships, had them ferried over with their
forces to the Asiatic shore.<a name="FNanchor_458" id="FNanchor_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> As they advanced beyond Nicomedia
past the battle field where the forces of Peter the Hermit
had met disaster the previous winter, the Normans were moved
to tears at the sight of the whitening bones which still lay unburied;<a name="FNanchor_459" id="FNanchor_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
but pressing on without pausing, they reached Nicaea
in the first week of June.<a name="FNanchor_460" id="FNanchor_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> There they received an enthusiastic
welcome from the crusaders who had preceded them and who,
since the middle of May, had been besieging the city; and, passing
around to the southern side, they took up their position before
the walls between the forces of Robert of Flanders and Raymond
of Toulouse.<a name="FNanchor_461" id="FNanchor_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>For the remainder of the expedition the exploits of Robert are
for the most part merged in the general action of the Crusade and
must, for want of detailed information, be narrated briefly.
Though a leader of the first rank, Robert was hardly to be compared
with Godfrey of Bouillon, Bohemond, or Raymond of
Toulouse. He has, therefore, received but an incidental treatment
at the hands of the contemporary writers.</p>

<p>It is not recorded that Robert and his forces in any way distinguished
themselves at the siege of Nicaea. They had arrived
too late to share in the splendid victory over Kilij Arslan (Soliman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
II), sultan of Iconium, on 16 May.<a name="FNanchor_462" id="FNanchor_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> Doubtless they were
also too late to play an important part in the construction of
the elaborate siege machinery which formed so marked a feature
in the operations against the city. On 19 June Nicaea surrendered;<a name="FNanchor_463" id="FNanchor_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
and Robert hurried away with the other leaders to
congratulate the Emperor upon the victory and to share in the
rich gifts which Alexius was bestowing upon the Franks as a reward
for their services.<a name="FNanchor_464" id="FNanchor_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>Events moved rapidly after the fall of Nicaea. By 26 June
some of the crusaders were already on the march. Robert with
his habitual slackness took a more leisurely leave of the Emperor<a name="FNanchor_465" id="FNanchor_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
and did not advance till two days later. But he quickly
came up with the rest of the forces at a bridge over a small tributary
of the Sangarius; and from that point the whole crusading
host moved forward on the morning of 29 June before daybreak.<a name="FNanchor_466" id="FNanchor_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
Either by accident or design the army was separated into two
divisions,<a name="FNanchor_467" id="FNanchor_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> which advanced by different, but roughly parallel,
routes. At the head of the smaller force, mainly composed of
Normans, marched the Norman leaders, Robert Curthose, Bohemond,
and Tancred. Raymond, Godfrey, Hugh of Vermandois,
and Adhemar, bishop of Le Puy, with their followers made
up the larger division. As the Normans pitched camp on the
second evening their scouts reported the enemy’s presence ahead,
and special watches were set to guard the tents; but the night
passed without incident. When, however, on the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
morning (1 July) the march was resumed, the way was soon
barred by the enemy in force under the command of Kilij Arslan.
The Normans hastily prepared for battle; and towards eight or
nine o’clock an engagement was begun which continued with
uninterrupted fury till well after midday. Though the Normans
fought valiantly, they could not long maintain the unequal contest.
The mounted knights were hurled back in disorder upon the
foot soldiers; and the heroic efforts of Bohemond and Robert to
rally their forces and resume the offensive were of no avail. The
crusaders, greatly outnumbered, and terrified by the outlandish
modes of warfare practiced by their enemies, were overwhelmed
and thrown back in wild confusion upon their camp. It was a
desperate moment. The Christian forces were packed together
“like sheep in a fold.” Priests were praying, knights were prostrate
confessing their sins. The panic was general. But suddenly,
when all seemed lost, relief came. Earlier in the day a messenger
had been despatched to the crusaders of the other division,
who were advancing at some distance by a separate route. When
they learned of the desperate plight of the Normans, they rushed
to arms, and, by hard riding across country, arrived upon the
scene of battle barely in time to save their companions from annihilation.
Strengthened by these reënforcements, the Normans
quickly re-formed their battle order and renewed the contest; and
the Turks, unexpectedly confronted by an enemy doubled in
numbers, turned in flight and were swept from the field. The
crusaders pursued them till nightfall, plundered their camp, and
took quantities of booty.<a name="FNanchor_468" id="FNanchor_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>There can be no doubt that Robert Curthose fought bravely, as
befitted one of his ancestry,<a name="FNanchor_469" id="FNanchor_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> on the field of Dorylaeum. But the
accounts, nearly contemporary though they be, which picture
him as the supremely brave leader, whose heroic action checked
the rout of the Christians and saved the day, belong rather to the
realm of legend than of sober history.<a name="FNanchor_470" id="FNanchor_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> A just estimate based<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
upon strictly reliable sources must recognize that Robert divided
the honors of Dorylaeum with Bohemond and the other leaders,
but must assign him a part in the battle somewhat subordinate to
that played by the great leader of the southern Normans.</p>

<p>The rout of the Turks at Dorylaeum opened the way through
Asia Minor; and on 4 July,<a name="FNanchor_471" id="FNanchor_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> after a two days’ halt to rest and to
bury the dead,<a name="FNanchor_472" id="FNanchor_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> the crusaders entered upon the long march to
Antioch, the great Seljuk stronghold in northern Syria.<a name="FNanchor_473" id="FNanchor_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> No
serious opposition was encountered from the enemy; and on 20
October,<a name="FNanchor_474" id="FNanchor_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> after three and a half months of varied hardships,
they arrived at the so-called Iron Bridge (Djisr el-Hadid) over
the Orontes a few miles above Antioch. Robert Curthose led the
vanguard<a name="FNanchor_475" id="FNanchor_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> which encountered outposts of the enemy at the
bridge and defeated them in a sharp engagement; and that night
the crusaders camped beside the river.<a name="FNanchor_476" id="FNanchor_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> Next day (21 October)
they pushed on to Antioch and took up their positions before the
city.<a name="FNanchor_477" id="FNanchor_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>The siege of Antioch was a problem fit to try the resources,
spirit, and endurance of the greatest commander. Its massive
walls and towers, far superior to anything then known in western
Europe, rendered it impregnable by assault. It was held by a
strong garrison under the command of a resourceful emir; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
besiegers were in constant danger from a sortie in force. Moreover,
the beleaguered garrison was not to be left without assistance;
and more than once the crusaders had to meet and drive off
a relief force in greatly superior numbers. And finally, the food
problem soon became so acute as to threaten the besiegers with
starvation; and to hunger were added the hardships of the winter
season. Plainly this was not the kind of warfare which appealed
to the easy-going, pleasure-loving Robert of Normandy. During
the early stages of the siege, while the abundant supplies of a
fertile district still held out, he played his part with courage and
spirit, as, for example, when he joined with Bohemond and Robert
of Flanders in a victorious fight against the Turks on the Aleppo
road near Harim in November.<a name="FNanchor_478" id="FNanchor_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> But when, in December, the
crusaders began to feel the pinch of famine,<a name="FNanchor_479" id="FNanchor_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> Robert could not
withstand the temptation to withdraw to more pleasant winter
quarters at Laodicea.<a name="FNanchor_480" id="FNanchor_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>Though the preaching of the Crusade had aroused little enthusiasm
among the upper classes in England, it had met with a
curious response among the English seamen. Assembling a considerable
fleet, they had passed the Straits of Gibraltar and
arrived off the Syrian coast well in advance of the crusading
forces which were making their way across the highlands of Asia
Minor; and in concert with the Emperor—who, it must not be
forgotten, was coöperating with the crusaders both by land and
sea—they had captured Laodicea and established themselves
there before the land forces had arrived at Antioch. Well
stocked with provisions from Cyprus, and protected from pirates
by the English fleet, which secured its trade communications with
the islands, Laodicea offered tempting quarters for one who had
tired of the rigors of the winter siege at Antioch. Moreover, the
English mariners appear to have been menaced in their possession
by wandering bands of the enemy in the surrounding country and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
in need of reënforcements. Accordingly, they appealed to Robert
of Normandy as their most natural lord among the crusading
chieftains, and besought him to come to Laodicea as their
protector.</p>

<p>Accepting this invitation with alacrity, Robert retired from
Antioch in December 1097, and, joining his friends at Laodicea,
gave himself up to sleep and idleness, content with forwarding a
part of the abundant provisions which he enjoyed to his suffering
comrades at the siege. The situation of the besiegers, however,
was precarious, and they could not long remain indifferent to the
absence of so important a leader as Robert. Soon they summoned
him to return; and when their appeal met with no response,
they repeated it and finally threatened him with excommunication.
Thus pressed, Robert had no choice but to yield,
and, very reluctantly turning his back upon the comforts of
Laodicea, he returned to the hardships of the siege.</p>

<p>Robert was back at Antioch for the crisis of 8 and 9 February
1098, which was brought on by the arrival of Ridwan of Aleppo at
the head of a large Turkish relief force. He attended the war
council of 8 February which determined upon a plan of action;<a name="FNanchor_481" id="FNanchor_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
and next day, while Bohemond and the mounted knights were
winning their splendid victory over the forces of Ridwan,<a name="FNanchor_482" id="FNanchor_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> he
assumed command, along with the bishop of Le Puy and the
count of Flanders, over the foot soldiers who remained behind to
maintain the siege and guard the camp.<a name="FNanchor_483" id="FNanchor_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> And though the
Turkish garrison attempted a sortie in force from three gates,
Robert and his comrades kept up a hard but victorious struggle
throughout the day, and at nightfall drove the enemy back
within the walls.<a name="FNanchor_484" id="FNanchor_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>From the defeat of Ridwan of Aleppo until the capture of
Antioch, 3 June 1098, we lose sight of Robert completely; and
it must remain a matter of doubt whether he was privy to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
secret negotiations by which Bohemond, corrupting a Turkish
guard, succeeded at last in opening the gates of the impregnable
fortress.<a name="FNanchor_485" id="FNanchor_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> Robert was certainly present at the capture of Antioch<a name="FNanchor_486" id="FNanchor_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>
and played his part honorably in the trying days which
followed.</p>

<p>The month of June brought the crusaders face to face with the
gravest crisis with which they had yet been confronted. The
citadel of Antioch still held out against them; and, within two
days after their victorious entrance into the city, advance guards
of a vast Moslem army under the command of Kerboga of Mosul
arrived before the gates. By the 8th of the month the Franks
were compelled to burn their outworks and retire within the walls,
themselves to stand a siege.<a name="FNanchor_487" id="FNanchor_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> Though not especially mentioned,
Robert doubtless took his part in the all-day struggle of 10 June;
and when, next morning, it was discovered that a panic was
spreading through the ranks, and that some of the forces, followers
of Robert among them, had already let themselves down over the
wall and fled,<a name="FNanchor_488" id="FNanchor_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> he promptly joined with the other leaders in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
solemn oath by which they mutually bound themselves to stand
firm to the end.<a name="FNanchor_489" id="FNanchor_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> And when finally, on 28 June, it was decided to
stake all on a battle with Kerboga in the open, he led the third
division<a name="FNanchor_490" id="FNanchor_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> in the action and shared in the greatest victory of the
Christians during the First Crusade. A few days later he attended
the council at which it was determined, in view of the summer
heat and the scarcity of water, to postpone the advance upon
Jerusalem until 1 November;<a name="FNanchor_491" id="FNanchor_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> and with that the leaders parted
company.</p>

<p>How Robert passed the summer months, it is impossible to say.
Probably he sought cooler and more healthful quarters away
from pest-ridden Antioch. But he was evidently there again on
11 September, for he joined the other leaders in the letter to
Urban II in which they recounted the progress of the Crusade,
reported the death of Bishop Adhemar of Le Puy, and urged the
Pope himself to come and join them.<a name="FNanchor_492" id="FNanchor_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> Robert was certainly at
Antioch on 1 November, the day set for the general advance upon
Jerusalem.<a name="FNanchor_493" id="FNanchor_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>But the advance was again delayed by a bitter quarrel which
had broken out between Bohemond and Raymond of Toulouse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
over the possession of Antioch.<a name="FNanchor_494" id="FNanchor_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> And now we find Robert, in the
rôle of peacemaker, joining with the other disinterested leaders
who desired to respect their pledges to the Emperor in an effort
to arbitrate the difficulties.<a name="FNanchor_495" id="FNanchor_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> But all these efforts were in vain,
for when the arbitrators had arrived at a decision on the merits of
the case, they lacked authority to enforce their judgment, and
dared not announce it lest matters should be made worse.
Finally, however, a truce was agreed upon in the hope of continuing
the Crusade;<a name="FNanchor_496" id="FNanchor_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> and Robert departed with Raymond and
others to lay siege to Marra.<a name="FNanchor_497" id="FNanchor_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> But hardly had this place been
taken (11 December),<a name="FNanchor_498" id="FNanchor_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> when the quarrel between Bohemond and
Raymond flamed up afresh; and now the controversy spread
from the leaders to the ranks, and the army was divided into two
bitter factions.<a name="FNanchor_499" id="FNanchor_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> Again Robert joined the other leaders in
council at Rugia in an attempt to bring about a reconciliation;<a name="FNanchor_500" id="FNanchor_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
but again all efforts failed, and Raymond and Bohemond remained
at enmity.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the count of Toulouse, yielding to popular pressure
in the army, determined upon an independent advance to Jerusalem;
and in order to isolate his rival the more effectually, he
undertook to hire other leaders to follow him. To Godfrey of
Bouillon and to Robert Curthose he offered 10,000 <i>solidi</i>, to the
count of Flanders 6000, to Tancred 5000, and to others in accordance
with their dignity.<a name="FNanchor_501" id="FNanchor_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> Tancred definitely closed with the
offer,<a name="FNanchor_502" id="FNanchor_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> and there is reason for believing that Robert Curthose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
also accepted it.<a name="FNanchor_503" id="FNanchor_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> In any case, Robert joined Raymond and
Tancred at Kafartab, 14 January 1099, and two days later the
three leaders moved southward with their followers towards
Jerusalem, Robert and Tancred leading the vanguard while
Raymond brought up the rear. As they moved southward up the
beautiful valley of the Orontes, panic-stricken emirs along their
line of march sent to purchase peace at any price and poured out
their wealth in gifts, while the plunder of a fertile countryside
supplied the crusaders with still greater abundance.<a name="FNanchor_504" id="FNanchor_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> Crossing
the river at a ford a short distance above Shaizar, they made their
way over the mountainous divide and descended towards the sea
into the rich valley of El-Bukeia.<a name="FNanchor_505" id="FNanchor_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> Halting there for a fortnight’s
rest and the celebration of the Purification,<a name="FNanchor_506" id="FNanchor_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> they crossed
the valley and encamped before the great fortress of Arka on the
northern slopes of Lebanon (14 February). The neighboring
port of Tortosa fell into their hands almost immediately, and
when easy communication with the sea had thus been secured,
they settled down to the siege of Arka.<a name="FNanchor_507" id="FNanchor_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> This caused another
delay of three months, and though Robert, Raymond, and
Tancred each built siege towers,<a name="FNanchor_508" id="FNanchor_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> no progress was made towards
reducing the fortress. Even with the aid of Godfrey and Robert
of Flanders, who came up with their forces 14 March, all their
efforts were unavailing.<a name="FNanchor_509" id="FNanchor_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, fresh disputes arose within the ranks of the army;
and the Provençals, who at Marra had vented their rage upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
Bohemond and his followers, now turned against Robert and the
northern Normans. The genuineness of the so-called Holy Lance
had been called in question.<a name="FNanchor_510" id="FNanchor_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> Many of the Normans believed
that the discovery of the Lance at Antioch had been a mere hoax
got up by the vision-loving followers of Count Raymond; and on
this question opinion in the army was sharply divided.<a name="FNanchor_511" id="FNanchor_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> Arnulf
of Chocques, Duke Robert’s chaplain, was regarded as the “chief
of all the unbelievers,”<a name="FNanchor_512" id="FNanchor_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> and upon him the bitter hatred of the
Provençals was concentrated. An attempt was made to settle the
controversy by an ordeal; but this resulted indecisively, and
each side continued to believe as before. Arnulf was firmly supported
by the duke and the Norman party generally, and the
attacks of his enemies met with no success.<a name="FNanchor_513" id="FNanchor_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p>While time was thus being wasted in disputes and recriminations
the season was rapidly advancing; and since Arka showed
no signs of capitulating, the leaders, Duke Robert among them,
decided to abandon the siege and push on forthwith to Jerusalem.<a name="FNanchor_514" id="FNanchor_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>
Breaking camp 13 May, they advanced along the coast
road by rapid marches, and on 7 June arrived before the Holy
City,<a name="FNanchor_515" id="FNanchor_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> ‘rejoicing and exulting.’<a name="FNanchor_516" id="FNanchor_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>Of the multitudes who had set out from Europe three years
before, comparatively few had endured to complete this last stage
of the pilgrimage. Not only were the ranks of the army greatly
thinned, but half of the leaders had either fallen behind or turned
back. The bishop of Le Puy had died at Antioch the previous
August; Baldwin, Duke Godfrey’s brother, had turned aside to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
become count of Edessa; Bohemond had remained to pursue his
ambitious schemes at Antioch; Hugh of Vermandois had been
sent upon a mission to the Emperor; and Stephen of Blois had
deserted and returned to Europe to face the reproaches of his
more heroic Norman wife.</p>

<p>With forces so diminished, a complete investment of Jerusalem
was out of the question. If the city was to be taken at all, it
would have to be carried by storm. The crusaders, therefore,
selected approaches and prepared for an assault upon the walls.
If, as has been suggested, Robert Curthose had been, since the
previous January, in the hire of Raymond of Toulouse,<a name="FNanchor_517" id="FNanchor_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> the connection
between them was now severed; and during the siege of
Jerusalem Robert’s operations were strategically combined with
those of Duke Godfrey and Robert of Flanders. With them he
took up his position before the northern wall to the west of
St. Stephen’s church.<a name="FNanchor_518" id="FNanchor_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p>The assault upon the city on 13 June failed miserably through
the almost complete lack of siege machinery; and it became clear
that far more elaborate preparations would have to be made. It
was decided, therefore, to construct at all costs two movable
wooden siege towers and other apparatus.<a name="FNanchor_519" id="FNanchor_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> Count Raymond
assumed responsibility for one of the towers; the providing of the
other was undertaken by Godfrey, Robert Curthose, and Robert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
of Flanders.<a name="FNanchor_520" id="FNanchor_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> Owing to the barrenness of the region around
Jerusalem, wood for the construction was not to be had near at
hand; but guided by a friendly Syrian Christian, the two Roberts
with a band of knights and foot soldiers made their way to a distant
forest in the hills ‘in the direction of Arabia’, and, loading
wood upon camels, brought it back to Jerusalem, where the building
operations were pushed forward with feverish activity for
almost four weeks.<a name="FNanchor_521" id="FNanchor_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> When the work had almost reached completion,
Godfrey and his associates determined upon a sudden
change of plan; and, during the night of 9-10 July, they had
their tower and other engines taken apart and moved a mile eastward
towards the valley of Jehoshaphat, to a point where level
ground offered a good approach, and where the wall was weaker,
not having been reënforced by the beleaguered garrison.<a name="FNanchor_522" id="FNanchor_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>During the next three days the siege tower and other apparatus
were again assembled and set in order for action; and at dawn
14 July the assault was begun.<a name="FNanchor_523" id="FNanchor_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> All day long it was pressed with
vigor, and though the defenders fought with the heroism of
desperation, endeavoring to set fire to the tower as it was moved
forward,<a name="FNanchor_524" id="FNanchor_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> all their efforts failed. Next morning at daybreak the
attack was renewed, Robert Curthose and Tancred operating the
mangonels which cleared the way for the tower to be rolled up
close to the wall.<a name="FNanchor_525" id="FNanchor_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> The garrison still stood stoutly to the defence
and let down bags filled with straw to break the shock of the
missiles hurled from the mangonels. The Christians were filled
with discouragement.<a name="FNanchor_526" id="FNanchor_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> But as the hour approached at which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
Saviour was raised upon the cross (9 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span>), their mighty effort at
last was crowned with success.<a name="FNanchor_527" id="FNanchor_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> With burning arrows they
managed to fire the sacks of straw with which the wall was protected;
and as the flames burst forth the defenders were compelled
to retire. Then dropping a bridge from the tower to the
wall, the crusaders rushed across and carried all before them.<a name="FNanchor_528" id="FNanchor_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>
Soon the gates were opened and the city was given over to carnage
and plunder.<a name="FNanchor_529" id="FNanchor_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> With victory assured, the blood-stained
warriors paused momentarily in their work of destruction, and,
“rejoicing and weeping from excess of joy,” turned aside to
render adoration at the Sepulchre and fulfil their vows;<a name="FNanchor_530" id="FNanchor_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> but
not for two days were the pillage and slaughter ended.<a name="FNanchor_531" id="FNanchor_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p>It remained for the crusaders to elect a ruler of the newly conquered
city and territory. After two conferences<a name="FNanchor_532" id="FNanchor_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> and much
discussion the choice of the leaders fell upon Godfrey of Bouillon,
the position having first been offered to Raymond of Toulouse.<a name="FNanchor_533" id="FNanchor_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>
“Though unwilling,” Godfrey was elected “advocate of the
church of the Holy Sepulchre.”<a name="FNanchor_534" id="FNanchor_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> A generation later the belief
was widely current that the honor had also been offered to Robert
Curthose and declined by him;<a name="FNanchor_535" id="FNanchor_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> but it rests upon no acceptable
contemporary authority, and appears to have been a later
invention.</p>

<p>Hardly had Godfrey been raised to his new dignity when he became
involved in a dispute with the count of Toulouse, not unlike
the quarrel which had arisen between Raymond and Bohemond
after the capture of Antioch. Raymond was holding the Tower
of David and declined to hand it over to the new ruler. But Godfrey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
was strongly supported in his just demand by Robert Curthose
and Robert of Flanders and by many even of Raymond’s
own followers, who were eager to return home and desired the
count to lead them; and under pressure Raymond, always sensitive
to popular opinion, was obliged to yield.<a name="FNanchor_536" id="FNanchor_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> It was during this
same period that Duke Robert’s chaplain, Arnulf of Chocques,
was raised to the dignity of acting patriarch of Jerusalem (1 August).<a name="FNanchor_537" id="FNanchor_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>
Though only a priest—perhaps not even in subdeacon’s
orders—and of obscure birth, he had contrived by his
learning, personality, and eloquence to make himself the leader
of the anti-Provençal party; and his elevation to this high position
was another notable victory for the enemies of Count
Raymond.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a new peril arose to menace the crusaders in the
enjoyment of their conquests. Before any of the leaders had completed
their preparations for the homeward journey, news arrived
that the emir Malik el-Afdhal, grand vizier of the caliph of
Egypt, was rapidly approaching at the head of a great army.<a name="FNanchor_538" id="FNanchor_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>
Once more the crusaders were to be put to the test of a battle in
the open with an enemy in greatly superior numbers. On 11 August
the leaders concentrated their forces in the vicinity of Ascalon
and prepared for battle.<a name="FNanchor_539" id="FNanchor_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> Next morning at dawn they
advanced into a pleasant valley near the seashore and drew up
their forces in battle order. Duke Godfrey led the left wing,
farthest inland, Count Raymond the right beside the sea, while
the centre was commanded by the two Roberts, Tancred, and
Eustace of Boulogne.<a name="FNanchor_540" id="FNanchor_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> When all was ready, the crusaders
moved forward, while the Saracens held their positions and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
awaited the attack.<a name="FNanchor_541" id="FNanchor_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> As the opposing forces came together
Robert Curthose perceived the standard of the emir—a lance of
silver surmounted by a golden sphere—which served as the
rallying point for the Saracen forces; and charging the standard-bearer
at full speed, he wounded him mortally<a name="FNanchor_542" id="FNanchor_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> and caused the
standard itself to be captured by the crusaders. Spurred on by
Robert’s brilliant example, the count of Flanders and Tancred
dashed forward to the attack and carried all before them right
into the enemy’s camp. The victory of the centre was complete;
and the Saracens broke and fled, many of them being slain by the
Christians who pursued them. Vast quantities of booty were
taken and borne away by the victors to Jerusalem.<a name="FNanchor_543" id="FNanchor_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> Robert of
Normandy purchased for twenty marks of silver the standard of
the emir, which had been captured by his own heroic act, and presented
it to Arnulf, the acting patriarch, to be placed in the
church of the Sepulchre as a memorial of the great victory.<a name="FNanchor_544" id="FNanchor_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p>With the battle of Ascalon the contemporary histories of the
Crusade come abruptly to an end, and it becomes more difficult
than ever to piece together a connected account of the exploits of
Robert Curthose in the Holy Land. If the account of Ordericus
Vitalis can be trusted, he again assumed the rôle of mediator,
together with Robert of Flanders, in the fresh quarrel which
broke out between Godfrey and the count of Toulouse over the
expected surrender of Ascalon.<a name="FNanchor_545" id="FNanchor_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> But his efforts met with no
success, and the Saracens, learning of the dissension among the
leaders, closed their gates. For more than fifty years Ascalon
remained in the hands of the enemy, a constant menace to the
peace and prosperity of the Latin Kingdom.</p>

<p>Nothing now remained to detain longer in the Holy Land
Robert Curthose and Robert of Flanders, and other crusaders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
who had no personal ambitions to promote. Having bathed in
the Jordan and gathered palms at Jericho according to the immemorial
custom of Jerusalem-farers,<a name="FNanchor_546" id="FNanchor_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> they took leave of Godfrey
and Tancred and set forth upon the homeward journey in
company with Count Raymond.<a name="FNanchor_547" id="FNanchor_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> As they proceeded northward
by the coast road they learned that Bohemond had taken advantage
of their absence in the south to lay siege to the friendly
city of Laodicea. But making a short halt at Jebeleh, they
quickly came to an understanding with the Laodiceans; and
when they had compelled Bohemond to retire from his disgraceful
enterprise, they were received into the city with great rejoicing.<a name="FNanchor_548" id="FNanchor_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>
It was then the month of September.<a name="FNanchor_549" id="FNanchor_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> Raymond, who
by this time—as Chalandon has made perfectly clear<a name="FNanchor_550" id="FNanchor_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>—was
acting in close agreement with Alexius, garrisoned the fortresses
in the Emperor’s name and remained to hold the city against the
machinations of Bohemond.<a name="FNanchor_551" id="FNanchor_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p>After a brief sojourn at Laodicea, Robert Curthose and Robert
of Flanders and many of their comrades continued their homeward
journey by sea,<a name="FNanchor_552" id="FNanchor_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> embarking, apparently, upon imperial
ships and sailing for Constantinople, where they were magnificently
received by the Emperor.<a name="FNanchor_553" id="FNanchor_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> To all who would enter his
service he offered great rewards and honors; but the two Roberts
desired to push on homeward without delay. Accordingly, he
presented them with rich gifts and granted them markets and a
free passage through his territories; and so they returned to Italy
and were received with great rejoicing by Roger of Sicily, Roger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
Bursa, Geoffrey of Conversano, and other relatives and compatriots.<a name="FNanchor_554" id="FNanchor_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p>Here Duke Robert paused and comfortably rested upon his
enviable reputation while he enjoyed the sumptuous entertainment
of admiring friends and made plans for the future. His
position during this second sojourn in Italy was indeed an enviable
one. For once in his life he had played a distinguished part in a
great adventure worthy of the best traditions of the Normans.
It is true that he had not displayed so great energy and resourcefulness
as some of the other leaders. Bohemond and Tancred,
had they been present, might in a measure have eclipsed his
fame. But for the moment he stood without a rival; and it is
little wonder that he gained the hand of one of the great heiresses
of Norman Italy together with a dower sufficiently rich to enable
him to redeem his duchy.<a name="FNanchor_555" id="FNanchor_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p>The Crusade had been a fortunate venture in the life of Robert
Curthose. He had set out from Normandy with a record of continuous
failure and a reputation for weakness and incompetence.
He was now returning with all the prestige and glory of a great
crusading prince, his past sins and failures all forgotten. He was
soon to become a hero of romance; and, among modern writers,
Freeman has not hesitated to praise him as a skilled commander,
“ever foremost in fight and council.”<a name="FNanchor_556" id="FNanchor_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> But a careful reading
of the sources hardly justifies the bestowal of such praise. Robert
had, it is true, shown some fine qualities as a crusader. He had
kept faith with the Greek Emperor and won his lasting gratitude.
His generosity and good-fellowship had gained him many friends
and followers,<a name="FNanchor_557" id="FNanchor_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> and it is not recorded that any one was his enemy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
As a warrior he had always fought with distinguished bravery, and
in the battle of Ascalon, at least, he had performed a greater feat
of arms than any of his comrades. He had gone to the Holy
Land with no ulterior ambitions, and in this respect he stands in
happy contrast with the self-seeking Bohemond and the grasping
count of Toulouse. His disinterestedness had gained him a certain
distinction enjoyed by no other crusader, save perhaps his
cousin, Count Robert of Flanders; and it is not without reason
that he appears frequently among the peacemakers, who in the
general interest undertook to reconcile the quarrels of rival
leaders. Yet he was still the same indulgent, affable, ‘sleepy
duke,’<a name="FNanchor_558" id="FNanchor_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> who had failed in the government of his duchy once and
was to fail again. Though brave and active in the moment of
danger, he was in no sense comparable as a general or as a statesman
with such leaders as Bohemond and Godfrey; and on the
whole the judgment of Freeman must be reversed. Robert was,
so far as we know, never foremost in council; he was rarely foremost
on the field of battle; and he showed no particular capacity
for generalship. But with such qualities as he possessed, he was
content to coöperate harmoniously with the more active and
resourceful leaders, persevering on the way until the pagan
had been vanquished and the Sepulchre had been won. Not
unnaturally he returned to Europe in the enjoyment of fame
and honor.</p>

Flavigny it was to be for three years, according to Ordericus five, and according to
Robert of Torigny until the duke’s return from the Crusade.</p>

writers leave no doubt as to the resentment which it aroused. William
of Malmesbury (<i>G. P.</i>, p. 432) is very bitter against the abbot of Malmesbury because
of his action on this occasion and very specific as to the sufferings of his
church: “Denique die uno .xii. textus Evangeliorum, .viiiᵗᵒ. cruces, .viiiᵗᵒ. scrinia
argento et auro nudata et excrustata sunt.” Eadmer (p. 75) tells how Anselm was
obliged to borrow two hundred marks from the cathedral treasury, placing his
demesne vill of Peckham in <i>vif gage</i> for seven years as security.—On <i>vif gage</i> see

Manceau whom we can identify actually went on the First Crusade. It will be found
in Appendix D, nos. 22-24, 27, 30, 38, 47. An anonymous work entitled <i>Noblesse

noble Manceaux who answered Pope Urban’s call. The list is valueless, however,
since no evidence or authority is cited in any case, and the work is obviously based

Lucca, Robert Curthose and Robert of Flanders both had a hand in the secret
negotiations. Letter of the clergy and people of Lucca, in <i>Kreuzzugsbriefe</i>, p. 166.
But Bruno, though present at the capture of Antioch, was clearly not well informed
about these matters, and great importance cannot be attached to his statement.
According to Baldric of Dol (<i>H. C. Oc.</i>, iv, p. 55) and Ordericus Vitalis (iii, p. 537),
Robert was among the chiefs to whom Bohemond confided his plans on the eve of
putting them into execution. This is in no way unlikely, but Baldric and Ordericus
are not independent, and it must be acknowledged that they are a very uncertain
authority for such a point as this. The writers who were on the ground
make no mention of Robert Curthose in this connection.</p>

The author is conjectured to have been a Norman from southern Italy
who took part in the Crusade and afterwards settled at Antioch. He wrote after
1131.) William of Grandmesnil did not set out with Robert from Normandy, but
went from southern Italy. According to Tudebode, Ralph of Caen, and the <i>Historia
Belli Sacri</i>, Ivo of Grandmesnil was also among the fugitives. This act of
cowardice made a deep impression upon contemporaries. Ralph of Caen writes:
“At fratres, pudet, heu! pudet, heu! Normannia misit.” Guibert of Nogent,
as a friend of the family, declines to mention the family name in connection with
the incident.</p>

<p>It was evidently at this point that, according to Ordericus Vitalis, Robert was
joined by Hugh Bunel, son of Robert de Jalgeio, the fugitive assassin of Countess
Mabel, the cruel wife of Roger of Montgomery. Hugh had been provoked to the
crime in 1082 because Mabel had violently deprived him of his lawful inheritance,
and he had been obliged to flee for his life. He had gone first to Apulia and Sicily
and then to Constantinople. But still being pursued by the spies whom William
the Conqueror and Mabel’s powerful family had employed to take his life wherever
they might find him, he had fled from Christendom altogether; and for many years
had dwelt among the Moslems, whose language and customs he had learned. He
now offered his services to Robert Curthose, who received him kindly; and, being
an excellent warrior and familiar with all the deceptions and stratagems which the
pagans practised against the Christians, he was able to be of great service to the
crusaders. Ordericus, iii, pp. 597-598.</p>

<span class="smaller">FAILURE TO GAIN THE ENGLISH CROWN</span></h2>

<p>While Robert Curthose was loitering in southern Italy, enjoying
the hospitality of Norman friends and kinsmen, events of immense
importance for him were taking place beyond the Alps.
On 2 August 1100 William Rufus was slain while hunting in the
New Forest.<a name="FNanchor_559" id="FNanchor_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> News of the tragedy quickly reached the ears of
Henry Beauclerc, his younger brother, who was a member of the
royal party; and without a moment’s delay he put spurs to his
horse and galloped away to Winchester, the seat of the royal
treasury, and as lawful heir (<i>genuinus haeres</i>) imperiously demanded
the keys of the keepers. But the interests and the superior
claims of Robert Curthose did not go undefended in that
hour. William of Breteuil, son of William Fitz Osbern, had also
been a member of the king’s hunting party; and foreseeing
Henry’s design, he had ridden hard upon his heels to Winchester.
Arriving upon the scene before Henry had gained possession of the
treasure, he protested that Robert’s rights should be respected.
Robert, he declared, was beyond a doubt the Conqueror’s eldest
son; Henry had done him homage and sworn fealty to him as his
lord; Robert had long labored in the Lord’s service on the Crusade;
and now God was restoring to him, as if by miracle, the
duchy which he had relinquished for the love of Heaven. But
Henry was not to be balked in his purpose by any such scruples.
The crowd which had gathered to witness the altercation clearly
favored “the present heir who was claiming his right”; and
with such encouragement, Henry drew his sword and exclaimed
that he would never permit a “foreigner,” through “frivolous
delays,” to anticipate him in grasping the sceptre of his father.
Then friends and prudent counsellors intervened to allay the
dissensions, and, without any serious rupture, the supporters
of the duke gave way, and the castle and the royal hoard were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
handed over to Henry.<a name="FNanchor_560" id="FNanchor_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> In that moment Robert Curthose lost
a kingdom.</p>

<p>The rapidity with which events now moved forward, and the
intelligence and sureness of judgment which were introduced into
the direction of affairs, are highly indicative of the character and
determination of the man who had grasped the helm. “On
Thursday he [William Rufus] was slain, and on the morning after
buried; and after he was buried, those of the council who were
nigh at hand chose his brother Henry for king; and he straightways
gave the bishopric of Winchester to William Giffard, and
then went to London; and on the Sunday after, before the altar
at Westminster, promised to God and all the people to put down
all the injustices that were in his brother’s time; and to maintain
the best laws that stood in any king’s day before him. And then,
after that, the bishop of London, Maurice, hallowed him king;
and all in this land submitted to him and swore oaths and became
his men.”<a name="FNanchor_561" id="FNanchor_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> “And that nothing might be wanting to the aggregate
of happiness, Ranulf, the dregs of iniquity, was cast into the
gloom of a prison, and speedy messengers were despatched to
recall Anselm.”<a name="FNanchor_562" id="FNanchor_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> The news of the king’s death had, it may be
supposed, taken Henry entirely unawares. Yet within less than
four days he had surmounted all the difficulties connected with
the seizure of the kingdom and had sketched out the programme
of a reign. To Robert’s claim of primogeniture he had opposed
the fact that he alone had been born within the realm of England
and the son of a king and queen.<a name="FNanchor_563" id="FNanchor_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The very real argument that
Robert was still far away, and that his return could not be
awaited without grave peril to the nation, was also doubtless
used with telling effect.<a name="FNanchor_564" id="FNanchor_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The appointment of William Giffard to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
the vacant see of Winchester, the recall of Anselm, and the imprisonment
of the infamous Ranulf Flambard, the chief oppressor
of the late reign, were all measures calculated to announce in unmistakable
terms to church and clergy that the evils from which
they had suffered under William Rufus were at an end.<a name="FNanchor_565" id="FNanchor_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> And the
issue of the famous Charter of Liberties, in direct connection with
the coronation, was a proclamation to the nation that better days
were at hand.<a name="FNanchor_566" id="FNanchor_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Its publication in the counties must in some cases
have brought almost the first news of the tyrant’s death and of the
inauguration of the new reign. But not content with these measures,
Henry took another step well calculated to strengthen his
hold upon the affections of his English subjects. Giving up
‘meretricious pleasures,’ he married Matilda, “daughter of
Malcolm, king of Scotland, and of the good queen Margaret, King
Edward’s kinswoman, of the true royal line of England.”<a name="FNanchor_567" id="FNanchor_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> The
marriage was solemnized on Martinmas (11 November). At
Christmas, Henry gained the tacit recognition of his royal title
among the crowned heads of Europe. With King Philip’s full
permission, Louis, the king designate of France, paid him a state
visit with a distinguished suite, and was received with fitting
honors at Westminster.<a name="FNanchor_568" id="FNanchor_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> But this was not only an indication
that Henry had been received into the society of kings, it was an
earnest of the cordial relations which were to prevail between
the French and English courts until the critical years of the new
reign had passed. The triumph of Henry’s clear-cut, far-seeing
policy could hardly have been more complete. There were rocks
ahead, but at least he had made the vessel seaworthy, and with
firm and careful steering he might hope to avoid all perils.</p>

<p>Henry I had good reason for acting with precipitate haste in
making sure his hold upon the English crown, for the rumor ran<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
that his elder brother was returning from Italy, and was already
close at hand. The king had well grounded fears that unless he
made his position absolutely secure the English barons might
repent of their decision and withdraw their allegiance.<a name="FNanchor_569" id="FNanchor_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Robert Curthose was probably already on his way home from
southern Italy when William Rufus came to his tragic end in the
New Forest. Late in August, or early in September,<a name="FNanchor_570" id="FNanchor_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> he arrived
in Normandy with his newly won bride, the beautiful Sibyl of
Conversano, and was joyfully welcomed by his subjects.<a name="FNanchor_571" id="FNanchor_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Without
encountering any opposition, he entered into full possession
of his duchy,<a name="FNanchor_572" id="FNanchor_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> “except the castles which were occupied by King
Henry’s men, against which he had many onsets and contests.”<a name="FNanchor_573" id="FNanchor_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>There were many reasons for the cordial welcome which Normandy
extended her duke upon his return from the Crusade.
The old evils and abuses of his earlier reign had doubtless largely
been forgotten, while the rule of William Rufus, who had “trampled
Normandy under his feet”<a name="FNanchor_574" id="FNanchor_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> by reason of his warlike undertakings
and the extreme rigor of his justice,<a name="FNanchor_575" id="FNanchor_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> had prepared men’s
minds for a milder régime. Robert’s long labors in the Holy
War had brought him much prestige and made him a European
figure. The charms of his fair Italian bride<a name="FNanchor_576" id="FNanchor_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> struck the imagination
of the people. Moreover, the death of the late king had
been followed by a fresh outburst of private war in Normandy;<a name="FNanchor_577" id="FNanchor_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">[19]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
and the return of the legitimate duke, ‘as if by miracle,’ offered at
least a hope of the restoration of peace and order. But most important
of all, the critical state of English affairs left Henry I no
time or resources to turn his attention to the Continent; and,
except in so far as his garrisons might still hold out at Domfront
and in the Cotentin, he was powerless to prevent the restoration.</p>

<p>If Robert’s absence during the critical days of early August had
been fatal to his cause in England, the unexpected death of the
late king had nevertheless been his rare good fortune, so far as the
recovery of Normandy was concerned. Men saw in it the hand
of God exercised on behalf of the crusader.<a name="FNanchor_578" id="FNanchor_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Probably William
Rufus had never intended to restore the Norman duchy upon
Robert’s return from the Crusade.<a name="FNanchor_579" id="FNanchor_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> In any case, Robert could
not have hoped to recover it except by repayment of the loan for
which it had been pledged. Indeed, we know that while in Italy,
by means of his wife’s dowry and through the gifts of friends, he
had taken pains to provide himself with funds for the redemption
of the duchy.<a name="FNanchor_580" id="FNanchor_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> But the tragedy in the New Forest had obviated
this unpleasant necessity. Joyfully welcomed home, the weary
crusader entered into possession of his dominions without the
repayment of a single penny.</p>

<p>Robert’s first acts upon his return to Normandy are eminently
characteristic, and they contrast strangely with the unparallelled
energy and decision with which Henry was pressing forward to his
goal in England. Far from giving his undivided attention to the
grave problems of his distracted state, he went with his wife on
pilgrimage to Mont-Saint-Michel to render thanks to God and the
archangel for his safe return from the Crusade.<a name="FNanchor_581" id="FNanchor_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Then, if Wace
may be trusted, he went to Caen to visit his sister, Abbess Cecilia
of La Trinité, and presented her church with a splendid Saracen
banner which he had captured in the Holy War.<a name="FNanchor_582" id="FNanchor_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>While Robert was indulging in devotions and ceremonial and
Henry was absorbed in the affairs of his kingdom, events in
Maine were rapidly approaching a crisis which was to prove fatal
to Norman dominion in the county. During Robert’s absence on
the Crusade, William Rufus had reasserted with the utmost vigor,
but with questionable success, the Norman claim to rule in Maine.
Against him Helias of La Flèche had maintained a stubborn
resistance. And although towards the end of the Red King’s
reign he had been forced to retire beyond the frontier into his own
strongholds farther south, no sooner did he receive word of the
king’s death than he pushed forward again and recovered Le
Mans. But the citadel with its Norman garrison still held out
against him, and, obtaining reënforcements from Fulk le Réchin,
his Angevin overlord, Helias began to besiege it.</p>

<p>The events which followed are a perfect illustration of the prevailing
ideas of the feudal age. The commanders of the Norman
garrison had been set to guard the castle of Le Mans by their
lord, William Rufus, who was now dead. And there was a question
as to who was his legitimate successor, and, therefore, as to
whom they now owed allegiance. Obtaining a truce from Helias,
they sent to both Robert and Henry to seek aid or instructions.
Going first to Robert, their messenger found him “broken by the
hardships of his long pilgrimage, and preferring the quiet of the
couch to warlike exertions.” The plight of the Norman garrison
at Le Mans and the prospective loss of a county moved him
little. “I am wearied with long labor,” he is reported to have
said, “and my duchy of Normandy is enough for me. Moreover,
the barons of England are inviting me to cross the sea and are
prepared to receive me as their king.” Robert, therefore, advised
the commanders of the garrison to make an honorable peace.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
Getting no satisfaction from the duke, the envoy hastened to
England to ask aid of the king. But Henry was engrossed in the
affairs of his realm—which Robert’s return had rendered critical—and
he prudently decided not to embark upon a hazardous
foreign enterprise at that time. He thanked the Norman commanders
at Le Mans for their loyalty and consideration, but sent
their messenger away empty. And when they had thus “laudably
proved their fidelity,” they surrendered the citadel to Helias
of La Flèche, late in October, and marched out with the honors of
war.<a name="FNanchor_583" id="FNanchor_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>So ended the Norman domination in Maine. Helias of La
Flèche was now completely master of the county; and the betrothal
of Eremburg, his only daughter, to the oldest son of Fulk
le Réchin paved the way for its later union with Anjou. Not
until an Angevin count should succeed to the Norman duchy
were the two territories again to be brought under a single ruler.</p>

<p>It has been suggested that Henry I, while declining to aid the
Norman garrison at Le Mans, was already secretly negotiating
with Helias of La Flèche with a view to obtaining his aid against
Robert Curthose.<a name="FNanchor_584" id="FNanchor_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> But there is no evidence of any such negotiations;
and since it is not until several years later that Maine and
Anjou appear as active supporters of the king against the duke,
this hypothesis seems unwarrantable. In the autumn of 1100,
Henry was in no position to interfere in continental affairs. He
showed his wisdom and his sense of proportion in allowing Maine
to go its way, while he dealt with the more pressing problem of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
the investiture controversy with Anselm and the papacy and prepared
to frustrate the projects of disaffected subjects who were
already plotting his overthrow. The interests of Robert Curthose
in Maine, on the other hand, were more immediate, and Ordericus
Vitalis charges his inaction to his habitual indolence. But the
real cause of his indifference, it seems, was the fact that visions of
a second Norman conquest of England were already floating
before his unstable mind. Within a few months he was fairly
launched in preparations for an invasion of the island kingdom
and an attempt to gain the English crown.</p>

<p>As soon as Robert’s return from the Crusade became known in
England, “almost all the magnates of the land violated the
fealty which they had sworn”<a name="FNanchor_585" id="FNanchor_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> and entered into secret negotiations
for his elevation to the English throne.<a name="FNanchor_586" id="FNanchor_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Robert of Bellême
and his two brothers Roger and Arnulf, William of Warenne,
Walter Giffard, Ivo of Grandmesnil, and Robert, son of Ilbert de
Lacy, were the chief conspirators.<a name="FNanchor_587" id="FNanchor_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Accepting their proposals
with alacrity, Robert Curthose promptly relapsed into all the old
extravagant practices which had impoverished him and stripped
him of his inherited dominions during his earlier reign. To
Robert of Bellême he granted the castle of Argentan, the forest of
Gouffern, and lucrative rights attaching to the bishopric of Séez.<a name="FNanchor_588" id="FNanchor_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
Upon others he squandered the treasure which he had brought
back with him from Italy, while to others still he made extravagant
promises to be fulfilled out of the spoils of England.<a name="FNanchor_589" id="FNanchor_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> Yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
it is doubtless an exaggeration which pictures the king as deserted
by ‘almost all the magnates of the land.’ Some of the ablest and
most powerful of the barons remained loyal, among them Count
Robert of Meulan and his brother Henry of Beaumont, earl of
Warwick, Robert Fitz Hamon, Richard de Redvers, Roger
Bigot,<a name="FNanchor_590" id="FNanchor_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> and probably many others of less note.</p>

<p>During the autumn and winter the conspiracy smouldered,
causing the king no small concern. In his letter to Anselm immediately
after his coronation, Henry directed him in returning to
England to avoid Normandy and travel by way of Wissant and
Dover.<a name="FNanchor_591" id="FNanchor_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> And in his negotiations with Anselm after his arrival in
England (23 September 1100), he showed great anxiety lest the
archbishop should go over to the support of Robert, from whom
at that time it would have been easy to get full assurances on the
question of investitures.<a name="FNanchor_592" id="FNanchor_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Clearly the king regarded the situation
as critical; yet an invasion was hardly to be feared before the
following spring or summer.</p>

<p>It was in the spring that an untoward incident occurred, which
contributed not a little to bring the conspiracy to a head and to
precipitate the invasion. On 2 February 1101, Ranulf Flambard,
‘the dregs of iniquity,’ escaped from the Tower of London and
fled to Normandy.<a name="FNanchor_593" id="FNanchor_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Going straight to the duke, he was received
with favor, and, if we may rely upon Ordericus Vitalis, he was
charged with the administration of the duchy.<a name="FNanchor_594" id="FNanchor_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Henceforth, the
sources picture him as the chief instigator of the attack upon England.
Doubtless his well known talents were turned to good
account in the equipment of a fleet and in the assembling of the
“no small multitude of knights, archers, and foot soldiers”
which was gathered at Tréport ready for the crossing.<a name="FNanchor_595" id="FNanchor_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile, in England, the Pentecostal court (9 June) was
thrown into consternation by the news of an imminent invasion.<a name="FNanchor_596" id="FNanchor_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
The <i>curia</i> was honeycombed with treason, and king and magnates
regarded one another with mutual suspicion. Not knowing how
far the conspiracy had spread, Henry was in terror of a general
desertion by the barons. They, on the other hand, feared an increase
of royal power and the summary vengeance that would fall
upon them as traitors after the restoration of peace. At this
juncture, all discussion of the investiture controversy was set
aside, and king and barons alike turned to Archbishop Anselm as
the one man whose character commanded universal confidence
and who, by his position as primate of England, was constitutionally
qualified to act as mediator in such a crisis. Apparently
the nobles and people renewed their allegiance by a general oath;
and the king, on his part, extending his hand to the archbishop as
the representative of his subjects, “promised that so long as he
lived he would govern the realm with just and holy laws.”<a name="FNanchor_597" id="FNanchor_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>When this mutual exchange of assurances had somewhat
cleared the air, already thick with treason, the king proceeded
with his accustomed vigor to take measures to thwart the impending
attack. He sent ships to sea to head off the hostile fleet.
He gathered an army from all parts of the realm, and, marching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
to Pevensey “at midsummer,” he pitched a permanent camp
there and awaited the invasion.<a name="FNanchor_598" id="FNanchor_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Anselm joined the levy with
the knights due from his fief;<a name="FNanchor_599" id="FNanchor_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> but the archbishop’s services were
mainly moral rather than military.</p>

<p>As the duke’s forces for the invasion were being assembled at
Tréport, not far from Saint-Valery—the port from which the
Conqueror’s fleet had sailed in 1066—it was but natural to
expect that a landing would again be attempted at Pevensey. A
different plan, however, was adopted. Buscarls whom Henry had
sent to sea to head off the invasion were corrupted—through the
contrivance of Ranulf Flambard, it is said<a name="FNanchor_600" id="FNanchor_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>—and, deserting the
royal cause, accepted service with the duke as pilots of his fleet.<a name="FNanchor_601" id="FNanchor_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
With such guides the invaders easily avoided the ships which the
king had sent out against them, and sailing past Pevensey, where
the royal forces were awaiting them, they landed safely at Portsmouth
(21 July),<a name="FNanchor_602" id="FNanchor_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> and were welcomed by their confederates
within the kingdom.<a name="FNanchor_603" id="FNanchor_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Sending a defiance to the king,<a name="FNanchor_604" id="FNanchor_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> Robert
advanced upon Winchester, the seat of the royal treasury and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
chief administrative centre of the realm, and pitched his camp in
a strong position. Apparently he meant to attack the city;<a name="FNanchor_605" id="FNanchor_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> but
such a plan, if entertained, was quickly abandoned, and Robert
turned towards London and advanced as far as the forest of
Alton.<a name="FNanchor_606" id="FNanchor_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>It was a trying moment for the king, and the chroniclers describe
in moving terms the terrors which he suffered.<a name="FNanchor_607" id="FNanchor_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> Almost
despairing of his kingdom, they declare, he feared even for his
life.<a name="FNanchor_608" id="FNanchor_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> The successful landing of the invaders had given the signal
for further desertions among the disaffected barons.<a name="FNanchor_609" id="FNanchor_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> Many who
until this moment had maintained the appearance of loyalty now
openly aligned themselves with the duke, seeking to cloak their
infamous conduct by demanding unjust and impossible concessions
from the king. To this number belong Robert of Bellême
and William of Warenne,<a name="FNanchor_610" id="FNanchor_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> who clearly had been among the chief
conspirators from the beginning, and probably also William of
Mortain, earl of Cornwall.<a name="FNanchor_611" id="FNanchor_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> Robert of Meulan, who on every
occasion remained faithful to the king, was for paying these
base traitors in their own coin. He urged the king to conciliate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
them, “to indulge them as a father indulges his children,” to
grant all their requests, even though they demanded London
and York. When the storm had been weathered, he insinuated,
the king might visit condign punishment upon them and reclaim
the domains which they had wrung from him in his hour of
need.<a name="FNanchor_612" id="FNanchor_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>But in this dire hour Henry found a more powerful supporter
in Anselm. As treason thickened around the king, he placed his
trust in almost no one except the archbishop.<a name="FNanchor_613" id="FNanchor_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> Their quarrel
over investitures was no longer allowed to stand between them.
Eadmer affirms that Henry gave up his whole contention in that
matter, and promised henceforth to obey the decrees and commands
of the apostolic see.<a name="FNanchor_614" id="FNanchor_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> And with such assurances Anselm
threw himself heart and soul into the royal cause. Privately he
undertook to inspire the disloyal barons whom the king brought
before him with a holy fear of violating their plighted faith.<a name="FNanchor_615" id="FNanchor_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
But he went further. Mounting a pulpit in the midst of the host,
he harangued the forces upon their obligation to abide by their
sworn allegiance. His voice was like the blast of a trumpet calling
the multitude to arms. Raising their voices, they pledged their
goods and their loyalty to the king, upon condition that he put
away the evil customs which had come in with William Rufus and
that he keep good laws.<a name="FNanchor_616" id="FNanchor_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>Thus the church and the English people stood firmly behind the
king,<a name="FNanchor_617" id="FNanchor_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> and many of the barons who at first had contemplated desertion
seem to have been held back by the strong personal
influence of the archbishop. And, with such support, Henry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
moved forward to intercept the invaders,<a name="FNanchor_618" id="FNanchor_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> and came face to face
with them at Alton.<a name="FNanchor_619" id="FNanchor_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> Yet no battle ensued:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Dote li reis, dote li dus,</div>
<div class="verse">Mais io ne sai qui dota plus.<a name="FNanchor_620" id="FNanchor_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In this happy couplet Wace has described the situation exactly.
In spite of a very fortunate beginning, resolution failed the duke
and his supporters when it came to pressing their advantage
home.<a name="FNanchor_621" id="FNanchor_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> The king, too, notwithstanding the disaffection among
his barons, had been able to muster a formidable army. Probably
the desertions from the royal cause had been less numerous than
Robert and his supporters had anticipated.<a name="FNanchor_622" id="FNanchor_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> The battle, if
joined, would certainly be a bloody one. And, on his side, the
king was in no position to force the issue: the loyalty of a considerable
portion of his army was too doubtful. Moreover, it was
no part of Henry’s character to seek by arms what he could
achieve by diplomacy, a sphere in which he enjoyed a far greater
superiority. The chief supporters of both sides also hesitated. A
fratricidal war was as little attractive to the barons, whose families
were divided between the two opposing forces, as it was to the
two brothers who were the principals in the contest.<a name="FNanchor_623" id="FNanchor_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> And so
saner counsels prevailed, and leading barons from each side
opened negotiations for peace.<a name="FNanchor_624" id="FNanchor_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>The text of the treaty which resulted has not come down to us
in documentary form, but it is possible to reconstruct its terms
with some fulness from the narrative sources. Robert gave up all
claim to the English crown, released Henry from the homage
which he had done him on an earlier occasion—probably upon
the receipt of the Cotentin in 1088—and recognized his royal
title and dignity.<a name="FNanchor_625" id="FNanchor_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> It was not considered fitting that an English
king should remain the vassal of a Norman duke. On his side, the
king undertook to pay Robert an annual subsidy of 3000 marks of
silver<a name="FNanchor_626" id="FNanchor_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> and to surrender all his holdings in Normandy except the
great stronghold of Domfront.<a name="FNanchor_627" id="FNanchor_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> Long years before, when Henry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
had been a wandering exile, his fortunes at their lowest, the men
of Domfront had voluntarily called him in and made him their
lord; and on taking possession of their town and castle he had
solemnly sworn never to abandon them. The binding force of
this oath was now invoked as a pretext for the king’s retention of
a solitary outpost in Robert’s dominions. An amnesty provision
was added for the benefit of the barons with holdings on both
sides of the Channel who by supporting one of the brothers had
jeopardized their interests with the other. Robert undertook to
restore all Norman honors which he had taken from the king’s
supporters;<a name="FNanchor_628" id="FNanchor_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> and Henry promised the restoration of all English
lands which he had seized from partisans of the duke.<a name="FNanchor_629" id="FNanchor_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> A special
clause, of which we would gladly know the full significance, provided
that Count Eustace of Boulogne should have “his paternal
lands in England.”<a name="FNanchor_630" id="FNanchor_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> Further, it was agreed that, if either of the
brothers should die before the other and leave no lawful heir, the
survivor should succeed to his dominions whether in England or
in Normandy.<a name="FNanchor_631" id="FNanchor_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>So far the provisions of the treaty seem reasonably certain.
The remainder are more doubtful. Ordericus Vitalis asserts—and
his whole defence of Henry’s dealings with Robert down to
the latter’s overthrow at Tinchebray, and after, is founded upon
the assertion—that Robert and Henry entered into a sworn
agreement to recover all of the Conqueror’s domains which had
been lost since his death and to visit condign punishment upon
the wicked men who had fomented discord between them.<a name="FNanchor_632" id="FNanchor_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632" class="fnanchor">[74]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
Wace adds that each undertook, in case the other should be at
war, to furnish him with one hundred knights so long as the war
lasted.<a name="FNanchor_633" id="FNanchor_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> According to the Annals of Winchester, Ranulf Flambard
gave up his bishopric of Durham.<a name="FNanchor_634" id="FNanchor_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>The treaty, as finally agreed upon, was duly confirmed in accordance
with a custom of the period by the oaths of twelve great
barons on each side.<a name="FNanchor_635" id="FNanchor_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>Thus ended Robert’s last and greatest effort to gain the English
throne. The royal army was disbanded and sent home. A part
of the ducal forces were sent back to Normandy.<a name="FNanchor_636" id="FNanchor_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> But with the
rest, Robert remained in England for several months upon terms
of peace and friendship with his brother.<a name="FNanchor_637" id="FNanchor_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> May he possibly have
been awaiting the first instalment of the English subsidy? The
Chronicler does not fail to raise a characteristic lament, though
he makes no reference to oppressive gelds: “and his men incessantly
did much harm as they went, the while that the count continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
here in the country.” About Michaelmas Duke Robert
returned to Normandy.<a name="FNanchor_638" id="FNanchor_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>The treaty of Alton has been described as “the most ill considered
step in the whole of Robert’s long career of folly.”<a name="FNanchor_639" id="FNanchor_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> It
can hardly prove a surprise, however, to one who has followed
Robert’s course through that long career. The real folly lay not
so much in the making of the treaty as in the whole project of
overthrowing Henry I., once he had got fairly seated on the English
throne. It is hard to believe that the crown was within the
duke’s grasp as the two armies stood facing each other at Alton.
Henry had the support of the church and of the mass of his English
subjects. Only a faction of the nobles was against him. And
a single victory gained by the ducal forces would, it seems, hardly
have resulted in disaster for the royal cause. Robert had undertaken
a task which was beyond his power and his resources, a
fact which the king’s momentary weakness cannot disguise.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_583" id="Footnote_583"></a><a href="#FNanchor_583"><span class="label">[25]</span></a> The whole episode is related with much detail by Ordericus Vitalis in one of
his most pleasing chapters. Ordericus, iv, pp. 99-102. His whole account is in
general confirmed by the <i>Actus Pontificum</i> (p. 404), which, however, make no
mention of the envoy sent to Robert, and merely record that the besieged garrison
waited in vain for aid from the king. The date of the surrender of the garrison can
be placed definitely before 1 November 1100 on the evidence of a donation in favor
of Saint-Aubin of Angers. Archives départementales de la Sarthe, H 290 (<i>Inventaire
sommaire</i>, iii, p. 127). The document is dated in the year of King William’s
death “et recuperationis Helie comitis Cenomanorum,” 1100, indiction viii, kalends
of November. According to the <i>Actus Pontificum</i>, the garrison held out for more
than three months, but this is evidently an exaggeration, as it would carry us beyond
November. The surrender must, it seems safe to conclude, have taken place
on or very shortly before that date.</p>

<p>It is probable that the king’s promise to abide by his coronation charter and the
exaction of an oath of obedience from his subjects were extended to the whole
realm by means of writs addressed to the counties. One of these writs, that addressed
to the shire-moot of Lincolnshire, has been preserved. It reads in part as
follows: “Sciatis quod ego vobis concedo tales lagas et rectitudines et consuetudines,
quales ego vobis dedi et concessi, quando imprimis coronam recepi. Quare
volo ut assecuretis michi sacramento terram meam Anglie, ad tenendum et ad defendendum
contra omnes homines et nominatim contra Rotbertum comitem Normannie
fratrem meum usque ad natale domini; et vobis predictis precipio ut hanc
securitatem recipiatis de meis dominicis hominibus francigenis et anglis, et barones
mei faciant vobis habere hanc eandem securitatem de omnibus suis hominibus sicut
michi concesserunt.” <i>E. H. R.</i>, xxi, p. 506; facsimile, <i>ibid.</i>, xxvi, p. 488.</p>

<p>The account of the peace negotiations given by Ordericus (iv, pp. 113-114) differs
fundamentally from that of the English sources. According to him, it was
Henry and Robert personally, rather than their supporters, who came together and
made peace: “remotis omnibus arbitris, soli fratres scita sua sanxerunt.” The
noble envoys through whom they at first attempted to exchange messages turned
out to be base traitors, who desired war rather than peace, and who acted for their
own private advantage rather than for the public good. This led Henry to seek a
personal interview with Robert. Meeting in a great circle, around which “terribilis
decor Normannorum et Anglorum in armis effulsit,” their hearts were filled with
“the sweetness of fraternal love,” and, talking together for a little while, they made
peace and exchanged “sweet kisses.” Freeman has attempted, without success as
it seems to me, to reconcile this account with that of the English writers. <i>William
Rufus</i>, ii, appendix xx: pp. 688-691. I have rejected it as being essentially untrustworthy
for the following reasons: (1) It is in fundamental disagreement with
the English sources, which appear to be better informed. (2) It has all the appearance
of being a fancy picture, drawn from the author’s notion of what ought to have
happened under the circumstances. (3) It tends greatly to eulogize the king. This
last consideration suggests the need of caution in dealing with Ordericus’s statement
of the terms of the treaty.</p>

<p>Wace says that the mediators between the king and the duke were Robert of
Bellême, William of Mortain, Robert Fitz Hamon, and others whose names he has
not learned. <i>Roman de Rou</i>, ii, p. 442.</p>

agreed to relinquish “all that he held by force in Normandy against the count.”
It is possible that the duke had tacitly, if not actually, recognized Henry’s claim to
Domfront as legitimate—he had held it since 1092—and, therefore, that the
statement quoted refers only to Henry’s possessions in the Cotentin. In that case
there would be no disagreement between Ordericus and the <i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i>.
Wace must surely be mistaken in his statement that Henry retained the Cotentin
as well as Domfront. <i>Roman de Rou</i>, ii, p. 444.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_632" id="Footnote_632"></a><a href="#FNanchor_632"><span class="label">[74]</span></a> Ordericus, iv, p. 115. The phrase “omnia patris sui dominia” might refer,
as in the treaty of 1091, to the recovery of Maine; or it might refer more locally to
parts of the ducal demesne in Normandy which Robert had squandered upon favorites.
If it refers to Maine, it must have been a purely formal provision—perhaps
proposed by Henry for the diplomatic needs of the moment—for there is no evidence
that an attack upon Maine was contemplated. Ordericus (iv, pp. 162-163,
192) in recounting a later stage of the quarrel between Henry and Robert, applies
it to recent grants which the duke had made to Robert of Bellême in Normandy.
The provision for coöperation in the punishment of traitors, if not actually inconsistent
with the amnesty clause, is, at any rate, of a piece with Ordericus’s conception
of the treaty as made by the brothers in spite of their followers. It ought,
therefore, to be accepted with caution. Ordericus makes frequent use of it on later
occasions to justify Henry’s course of action toward Robert.</p>

Henry during his sojourn in England. Soon after the treaty of Alton had been concluded
Anselm was summoned to appear before the <i>curia regis</i>, and we are told
that it was by the advice of Duke Robert and his friends, who hated the archbishop
because he had frustrated their plans, that Henry demanded of Anselm that
he become his man and consecrate bishops and abbots whom the king had invested,
or else quit the realm. Eadmer, pp. 128, 131. On 3 September at Windsor Robert
confirmed two charters of donation by King Henry, the one in favor of Herbert,
bishop of Norwich, and the other in favor of John, bishop of Bath. W. Farrer,
“An Outline Itinerary of King Henry the First,” in <i>E. H. R.</i>, xxxiv, pp. 312,
313.</p>

<p>At some time before the battle of Tinchebray (29 September 1106) Bishop John
of Bath obtained a separate charter from Robert confirming donations of William
Rufus and Henry I. <i>Two Chartularies of the Priory of St. Peter at Bath</i>, ed. William
Hunt (London, 1893), i, p. 47, no. 44. The document is undated. It may have
been issued during Robert’s sojourn in England in 1101 or during one of his two
later visits, late in 1103 (cf. <i>infra</i>, pp. 148-149), or early in 1106 (cf. <i>infra</i>, p. 169);
or, indeed, it may have been issued at some other time in Normandy.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="smaller">THE LOSS OF NORMANDY</span></h2>

<p>Duke Robert’s ambitious attempt to drive Henry I from the
throne had ended in a signal failure. To be sure, he had gained
the promise of an annual subsidy of 3000 marks of silver, and
this must have seemed to him an important consideration. But
he had also revealed his weakness and indecision; and Henry can
hardly have looked upon the payment of the subsidy as more
than a temporary measure which would serve his purpose until
he was in a position to adopt a more aggressive course towards the
duke. By accepting a money payment in lieu of his claim upon
the English crown, Robert had inevitably been reduced from the
offensive to the defensive; and his continued failure to give strong
and effective government to Normandy was a standing invitation
to Henry to attack him. The treaty of Alton marked the beginning
of a path of disaster which was to lead the duke to the field
of Tinchebray and the prison walls of Cardiff.</p>

<p>From a military standpoint there had been little of the heroic
about Henry’s course in meeting the invasion. But he had won a
diplomatic victory of the first importance, and he was not slow
to take full advantage of his success. Regardless of the amnesty
which had been provided by the recent treaty, he proceeded at
once to take summary vengeance upon his enemies. Robert had
not yet left the realm when the first blow fell upon William of
Warenne and several others who were sent out of the kingdom
with him, “disinherited for his sake.”<a name="FNanchor_640" id="FNanchor_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> It soon appeared that a
like fate was in store for others of the duke’s late supporters.
King Henry did not proceed against them directly for calling in
the invader—that presumably would have been a needless violation
of the treaty—nor did he court disaster by attacking them
all at once. But one by one, and upon various charges, he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
them haled before his <i>curia</i> and condemned.<a name="FNanchor_641" id="FNanchor_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Ivo of Grandmesnil,
the crusader, attempted to engage in private war, a thing
before almost unknown in England, and was made to pay for his
presumption with a heavy fine. Covered with shame as he was,
as a result of his cowardice at Antioch, and convinced that he
would never be able to regain the king’s friendship, he found it
advisable to extricate himself from his difficulties by departing a
second time on crusade.<a name="FNanchor_642" id="FNanchor_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Robert Malet and Robert of Pontefract,
son of Ilbert de Lacy, were also disinherited and made to quit
the realm.<a name="FNanchor_643" id="FNanchor_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Before proceeding against his more powerful enemies of the
great house of Talvas, or Bellême, Henry made more careful preparations.
For the best part of a year he set his secret agents to
watch the terrible Robert, earl of Shrewsbury, and to gather
information against him, which was all carefully reduced to
writing.<a name="FNanchor_644" id="FNanchor_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Then suddenly, in 1102, the earl was summoned to
appear before the <i>curia regis</i>,<a name="FNanchor_645" id="FNanchor_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> accused upon forty-five separate
counts of words spoken or acts committed against the king or his
brother, the duke of Normandy. Tacitly admitting that his case
was hopeless, the great earl fled to his strongholds without pleading,
and was adjudged a public enemy.<a name="FNanchor_646" id="FNanchor_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> War followed. One by
one, the earl’s fortresses, Arundel, Tickhill, Bridgenorth, and
Shrewsbury, were reduced; and before Michaelmas<a name="FNanchor_647" id="FNanchor_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Robert of
Bellême was driven from England, an utterly defeated and disinherited
outlaw. “Filled with grief and rage,” he went over sea
and “spent his fury on the Normans.”<a name="FNanchor_648" id="FNanchor_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>It was not the king’s way to do things by halves. As soon as he
had finished with Robert, he took action against other members
of the Bellême family. Accusations were brought against Arnulf
and Roger, Robert’s brothers, and they were condemned to the
loss of their estates and driven from the realm.<a name="FNanchor_649" id="FNanchor_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> But even then
the king’s anger was not appeased or his appetite for plunder
sated; and he proceeded to confiscate the lands which the nuns of
the Norman monastery of Almenèches had received in England
through the generosity of Roger of Montgomery.<a name="FNanchor_650" id="FNanchor_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Their sole
offence lay in the fact that they happened to be presided over by
Abbess Emma, a sister of Robert of Bellême.</p>

<p>While Henry was thus engaged in extirpating his enemies in
England, Normandy under Duke Robert was increasingly a prey
to confusion and anarchy. As we have noted, the death of William
Rufus had been the signal for an outbreak of private war in
the duchy. In the very week that the news of the king’s death
was received, William of Évreux and Ralph of Conches made a
hostile incursion into the territory of Beaumont and plundered
the lands of Robert of Meulan. In a like spirit, others who had
been held in check by the rigor of the Red King’s justice now took
up arms and desolated the wretched country.<a name="FNanchor_651" id="FNanchor_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> It is probable
that the duke’s return from the Crusade and his attack upon England
in some degree mitigated these conditions of disorder. The
expedition against England could hardly have been fitted out and
launched amid such anarchy as Ordericus describes. And as the
turbulent barons prepared themselves for the foreign enterprise,
their minds and hands must necessarily have been turned away
from domestic feuds.</p>

<p>But for the same reason the failure of the attack upon England
reacted disastrously upon Normandy, and brought on disorders
hitherto unheard of. As Henry I expelled the outlaws from
England, they invariably sought a refuge in Normandy and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
attempted to recoup their damaged fortunes by indulging in the
worst excesses.<a name="FNanchor_652" id="FNanchor_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> For a time Robert Curthose showed some spirit
in dealing with the freebooters, though, if one accept the account
of Ordericus Vitalis even with considerable reservations, his
efforts did him little credit. When Henry embarked upon his
great struggle with the house of Bellême in 1102, he appealed to
Robert under the terms of the treaty of Alton to join him in the
enterprise. And the duke so far responded to his call as to assemble
the forces of Normandy and lay siege to the castle of
Vignats, a Bellême stronghold, which was held by Gerard de
Saint-Hilaire. It is reported that the garrison were ready and
even eager to surrender, had a vigorous assault been made to give
them a fair excuse. But the duke had little control over his undisciplined
host, and Robert de Montfort and other traitors in the
ranks fired the encampment and threw the whole army into a
panic. The ducal forces fled in wild confusion with none pursuing,
and the astonished garrison of Vignats shouted after them in
derision.<a name="FNanchor_653" id="FNanchor_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Realizing now that they had nothing to fear, they
issued from their stronghold and carried a devastating war
throughout the Hiémois, and, so far as is recorded, the duke made
no effort to repress them. Nothing remained but for the local
lords of the district to defend themselves. Robert of Grandmesnil
and his two brothers-in-law, Hugh de Montpinçon and Robert
de Courcy, assembled their vassals and did what they could
to check the freebooters. But their efforts met with small success.
Other Bellême garrisons from Château-Gontier, Fourches,
and Argentan joined with the plunderers from Vignats, and
their raids were carried far and wide. Only the strong could defend
themselves, and the homes of the unarmed peasantry were
pillaged and given over to the flames.<a name="FNanchor_654" id="FNanchor_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>If we have here a true account, Robert Curthose had proved
unequal to the task of putting down an insignificant body of
Bellême’s retainers and of keeping peace in the restricted territory
of the Hiémois. He was soon called upon to deal with the
arch-enemy of peace and order in person. It must have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
in the autumn of 1102 that Robert of Bellême, utterly discomfited
and overwhelmed in England, crossed over to Normandy
and began to vent his fury upon those of his countrymen who had
dared to join the duke in attacking his garrisons.<a name="FNanchor_655" id="FNanchor_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>The disorders of 1102 were but a prelude to those that followed
in 1103. We have only a fragmentary account of the events, but
the general impression of the picture is that of a war of unparalleled
violence and cruelty. Villages were depopulated, and
churches were burned down upon the men, women, and children
who had taken refuge in them. “Almost all Normandy” arose
as by common consent against the tyrant of Bellême. But the
movement was rendered ineffective for want of a strong and
persistent leader.<a name="FNanchor_656" id="FNanchor_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Robert of Bellême, on his side, possessed
almost unlimited resources. He is said to have held thirty-four
strong castles, all well stocked with provisions and ready for war.
Disregarding the claims of his brothers Roger and Arnulf, who
had suffered outlawry and exile on his account, he retained the
whole family inheritance in his own hands. While this kept his
resources intact, it cost him the support of his brothers. Roger
retired from the conflict and spent the rest of his life upon his
wife’s patrimony at Charroux. But Arnulf in high indignation
deserted the family cause and threw in his lot with Robert
Curthose, taking with him a considerable number of Bellême
supporters. Having recently captured the castle of Almenèches,
he turned it over to the duke, who assembled an army there and
prepared to press his advantage.<a name="FNanchor_657" id="FNanchor_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> With ‘almost all Normandy’
in arms against him, with one of his brothers in retirement, and
the other actively supporting the duke, the cause of Robert of
Bellême might well seem desperate. He even doubted the
fidelity of his closest friends. Yet, undismayed, he rushed to
Almenèches, and, without a moment’s hesitation, fired the nunnery
and burned it to the ground.<a name="FNanchor_658" id="FNanchor_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Overwhelming the ducal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
forces, he captured Oliver de Fresnay and many others, and subjected
not a few of them to horrible punishments. The duke,
admitting his defeat, retired to Exmes.<a name="FNanchor_659" id="FNanchor_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_659" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>The necessity of crushing Robert of Bellême now became more
imperative than ever, and for a time there seemed some prospect
of success. His violence and oppression had stirred up against
him not only the Normans, but some of his powerful neighbors
across the border. Rotrou of Mortagne joined forces with William
of Évreux and the men of the Hiémois. Robert of Saint-Céneri
and Hugh de Nonant also joined the movement with their
retainers. But even this swarm of enemies was unable to inflict a
crushing defeat upon the lord of Bellême. They could injure him
in numerous small engagements, but to overcome him, or inflict
any condign punishment upon him, was beyond their power.<a name="FNanchor_660" id="FNanchor_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>Robert of Bellême’s future in Normandy was finally determined
by a decisive battle with the duke, but the place and
date of the engagement are not recorded. We are without information
as to the duke’s movements after his retirement from
Almenèches to Exmes, though it seems clear that he reassembled
his troops and determined to renew the offensive against Robert of
Bellême. But the lord of Bellême did not wait to be attacked.
Drawing up his forces in battle order as the ducal army was approaching,
he launched a furious onslaught which carried all
before it. The duke was put to flight, and William of Conversano
and many others of his supporters were captured. Then,
laments the chronicler, “the proud Normans blushed for shame
that they, who had been the conquerors of barbarous foreign
nations, should now be vanquished and put to flight by one of
their own sons in the very heart of their own country.” Robert
of Bellême is said to have aspired to the conquest of the whole
duchy. Many of the Normans who hitherto had resisted him now
felt constrained to bow their necks beneath the yoke, and joined
the tyrant for the sake of their own safety. Pressing his advantage
home, he now gained possession of Exmes.<a name="FNanchor_661" id="FNanchor_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> The discomfiture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
of the duke was complete, and he had no choice but to
conclude a peace with his too powerful subject upon humiliating
terms.<a name="FNanchor_662" id="FNanchor_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>Bishop Serlo of Séez and Ralph, abbot of Saint-Martin of Séez,
unable any longer to bear the oppression of the tyrant, withdrew
from their posts and crossed over to England, where they were
cordially welcomed by Henry I.<a name="FNanchor_663" id="FNanchor_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> They were to be of no small
service to the king in the shaping of his future policy.</p>

<p>While the diocese of Séez was a prey to the indescribable confusion
of the struggle with Robert of Bellême, the Évrecin was not
spared the horrors of a private war. There the death of William
of Breteuil<a name="FNanchor_664" id="FNanchor_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> without legitimate issue,<a name="FNanchor_665" id="FNanchor_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_665" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> and a consequent disputed
succession, had reopened an ancient local feud.<a name="FNanchor_666" id="FNanchor_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> While
William was being buried at Lire, a natural son named Eustace
seized his lands and occupied the strongholds.<a name="FNanchor_667" id="FNanchor_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> But a nephew
named Renaud, of the illustrious Burgundian house of Grancey,
claimed the succession as legitimate heir. Many of the Normans
preferred a fellow countryman, though a bastard, to a foreigner,
and supported Eustace. But the ancient enemies of Breteuil
rallied around the Burgundian. William of Évreux led the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
movement, and was promptly joined by Ralph of Conches,
Amaury de Montfort, and Ascelin Goël.<a name="FNanchor_668" id="FNanchor_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> But Eustace was
supported by loyal and powerful vassals; and when he saw that
he could not win single-handed, he appealed for aid to Henry I,
who was quick to realize the advantages which the Breteuil succession
controversy offered for the inauguration of a far-reaching
policy of intervention in the internal affairs of Normandy. The
king not only promised Eustace the desired assistance, but he
gave him the hand of Juliana, one of his natural daughters, in
marriage.<a name="FNanchor_669" id="FNanchor_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> And further, he sent his able and trusted minister,
Robert of Meulan—who as lord of Beaumont had special interests
in the disturbed district—to Normandy to deal personally
with the situation and to warn Robert Curthose and the
Normans barons that unless they supported his son-in-law and
drove out the foreign intruder, they would incur his royal
displeasure. With such powerful backing, Eustace of Breteuil
gradually got the better of his rival—who waged the war with
such disgusting cruelty that he alienated many of his adherents—and
finally made himself master of the whole of his father’s honor,
and expelled the foreigner from the land.<a name="FNanchor_670" id="FNanchor_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>It was one thing to expel the foreigner; it was quite another to
overcome the local enemies of Breteuil who had rallied around the
intruder for the sake of their own advantage. With these,
Robert of Meulan undertook to deal, and he found them aggressive
enemies, if more nearly bandits and robbers than warriors.
Ascelin Goël, whose prison walls at Ivry had on a former occasion
closed around William of Breteuil, ambushed and captured a
certain John of Meulan, a rich burgess and usurer, when he was
returning from a conference with his lord, the count of Beaumont.
For four months the ‘avaricious usurer’ lay in Ascelin’s gaol.
Doubtless the financial resources of the wealthy burgess were of
no small concern to Robert of Meulan, and he made frantic
efforts to procure his release. But try as he might, he could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
extract him from the ‘wolf’s mouth.’ Finally he was obliged to
conclude a peace with William of Évreux, betrothing his infant
daughter Adelina to William’s nephew Amaury de Montfort.
Ralph of Conches, Eustace of Breteuil, Ascelin Goël, and the
other belligerent lords were included in the pacification, and
John of Meulan, the usurer, was set at liberty.<a name="FNanchor_671" id="FNanchor_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>It is not recorded that Robert Curthose interfered in any way
in this private war, or made any effort to suppress it. Perhaps he
was at the time wholly occupied by the struggle with Robert of
Bellême, or perhaps he may already have been on his way to England
on a mission of intercession for a friend. But before following
him again across the Channel, we must take some account of
his domestic affairs.</p>

<p>The Norman heiress, Sibyl of Conversano, whom Robert
brought back with him from Italy to be duchess of Normandy,
has been universally praised for her surpassing beauty, refinement
of manners, and excellent qualities.<a name="FNanchor_672" id="FNanchor_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Though she may have
had a few private enemies, she enjoyed a great popularity; and
Robert of Torigny affirms that at times during the duke’s absence
she was entrusted with the administration of the duchy, and that
in this capacity she was more successful than her husband.<a name="FNanchor_673" id="FNanchor_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> But
her beneficent career of usefulness was short indeed. Soon after
the birth of her only child,<a name="FNanchor_674" id="FNanchor_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> William the Clito, she died at
Rouen,<a name="FNanchor_675" id="FNanchor_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> and was buried, amid universal sorrow, in the cathedral
church, Archbishop William Bonne-Ame performing the
obsequies.<a name="FNanchor_676" id="FNanchor_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>The cause of Sibyl’s death is shrouded in mystery. William of
Malmesbury reports simply that she died shortly after the birth of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
her son, as the result of foolish advice given by the midwife.<a name="FNanchor_677" id="FNanchor_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
But Ordericus Vitalis does not spare us a dark scandal. According
to him Agnes de Ribemont, sister of the distinguished crusader,
had recently been left a widow by the death of her husband
Walter Giffard, and, becoming infatuated with Robert Curthose,
had entangled him in the snares of illicit love. By undertaking to
gain for him the aid of her powerful family connections against his
numerous enemies, she obtained from him a promise that, upon
the death of his wife, he would marry her and intrust her with the
administration of the duchy. Soon after, the beautiful Sibyl took
to her bed and died of poison.<a name="FNanchor_678" id="FNanchor_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> It seems almost incredible that
this tale should be anything but a malicious libel got up by some
of the duke’s unscrupulous enemies. Duchess Sibyl was probably
already dead before Agnes de Ribemont became a widow. But
in the chaotic chronology of the early chapters of the eleventh
book of Ordericus Vitalis, it is impossible to speak with any assurance,
and a dark saying of Robert of Torigny may possibly lend
some color to the scandalous tale.<a name="FNanchor_679" id="FNanchor_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>It would seem that with domestic bereavement, and the distractions
of rebellion and private war, Robert Curthose had
enough to occupy him within the limits of his duchy. Yet it was
apparently during this critical period that a foolish impulse of
generosity towards a friend led him to embark upon an enterprise
which resulted in further humiliation and disaster. William of
Warenne, one of the barons who had been deprived of his possessions
and honors in England after the failure of the invasion of
1101, came to the duke to complain that through loyalty to his
cause he had lost the great earldom of Surrey with its annual
revenue of 1000 pounds, and besought him to intercede with
King Henry in order that he might regain the earldom and the
royal favor. Apparently the duke had not yet realized the
character of his unscrupulous brother, or the hostile plans which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
Henry was maturing against him, and he readily consented to
William of Warenne’s request.<a name="FNanchor_680" id="FNanchor_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>It must have been towards the end of the year 1103 that Duke
Robert crossed the Channel with a small suite of knights and
squires and landed at Southampton.<a name="FNanchor_681" id="FNanchor_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_681" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Henry I was quick to
realize the advantages of the situation, and with perfect unscrupulousness
he determined to use them to the utmost. Feigning
great indignation that Robert had presumed to enter his dominions
without permission and a safe-conduct, he sent his agents—Robert
of Meulan seems to have been chiefly charged with the
enterprise<a name="FNanchor_682" id="FNanchor_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_682" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>—to intimate to him that he was in grave danger of
capture and imprisonment. The duke was taken completely by
surprise. He had no armed force at his back. He was, in fact, at
the king’s mercy, although the externals of an honorable reception
were accorded him, and he was conducted to the royal court,
where negotiations were carried on in private. Henry charged
him with a violation of the treaty of Alton in that, instead of
punishing traitors with the rigor befitting a prince, he had made
peace with Robert of Bellême and had confirmed him in the
possession of certain of their father’s domains. The duke, appreciating
his helplessness in the situation in which he found himself,
humbly promised to make amends; but the king now informed
him that he desired something more than this—indeed, that he
would not permit him to quit the realm until he had surrendered
his claim to the annual subsidy of 3000 marks which was due him
under the terms of the treaty of Alton. In order that this crowning
humiliation might be cloaked in a garb of decency, the duke
was allowed to see the queen, his god-daughter, and to relinquish
the subsidy as if at her request.<a name="FNanchor_683" id="FNanchor_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> But this clever play upon his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
chivalrous nature could not conceal the character of the transaction.
Robert in his ineffable simplicity had been treacherously
taken and robbed. According to William of Malmesbury, the
king had even gone the length of inducing him to come to England
by a special invitation.<a name="FNanchor_684" id="FNanchor_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> However this may be, and whatever the
uncertainty about the details of this episode, the sources are
agreed as to the character of the part which the king had played
in it.<a name="FNanchor_685" id="FNanchor_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> Wace avers that it was only then that Robert began to
realize that his brother hated him.<a name="FNanchor_686" id="FNanchor_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>William of Warenne was now restored to the royal favor, and
recovered his earldom. And the duke, having given full satisfaction
in all that was demanded of him, was allowed to return to
Normandy, a greater object of contempt than ever among his
subjects.<a name="FNanchor_687" id="FNanchor_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> It can hardly be doubted that from this moment the
king had formed a deliberate project of depriving him of his
duchy and of reuniting Normandy to England. Step by step
Robert was paving the way to his own destruction, while Henry
with equal sureness was preparing himself for the final triumph.
Whatever prestige the duke had brought back with him from the
Crusade must long since have been dissipated. He had failed
lamentably in his attempt to gain the English crown, he had
failed to oust an ever encroaching enemy from the strongholds of
his duchy, he had failed to subdue his most powerful and lawless
subject, Robert of Bellême. He had placed no check upon the
anarchy of private war, he had wasted his fortune upon base
associates and barren enterprises, and he had alienated the Norman
church.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>Since the duke’s return from the Crusade, government in Normandy
seems to have been almost in abeyance. Nothing could
more surely have lost Robert the support of the church than the
unrestrained anarchy and disorder which prevailed. Yet there
were other grounds on which he was found wanting by the clergy.
While dissipating his treasure upon unworthy favorites and unscrupulous
courtiers, he had few favors to bestow upon religious
foundations. Only a single charter by the duke has survived
from the period after his return from the Crusade, a grant of a fair
and a market in the village of Cheux to the monks of Saint-Étienne
of Caen.<a name="FNanchor_688" id="FNanchor_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_688" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>But the church had greater and more positive grievances
against Robert Curthose. His peace and friendship with Robert
of Bellême were an unpardonable offence; and by granting lucrative
rights over the bishopric of Séez to this turbulent vassal,<a name="FNanchor_689" id="FNanchor_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
the duke had aroused enemies whose influence against him was
to prove disastrous in the crisis of 1105. As has already been
explained,<a name="FNanchor_690" id="FNanchor_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> Serlo, bishop of Séez, and Ralph, abbot of Saint-Martin
of Séez, deemed it intolerable longer to endure the oppression
of the tyrant; and going into voluntary exile, they
sought an asylum in England, where they were warmly welcomed
by Henry I.<a name="FNanchor_691" id="FNanchor_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_691" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> The value which the king attached to the
support and services of Abbot Ralph may perhaps be judged by
the fact that he was promoted to the see of Rochester in 1108
and made archbishop of Canterbury in 1114; and it is no mere
chance that it was Bishop Serlo who was to welcome King Henry
and his invading army in Normandy in 1105, and to preach the
sermon which was to stand as the public justification of the
king’s action in dispossessing his brother of the duchy.<a name="FNanchor_692" id="FNanchor_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>But the duke had sinned further against the church through
the practice of simony. A peculiarly flagrant case occurred in
1105 in connection with the abbey of Saint-Pierre-sur-Dives.
Upon the death of Abbot Fulk, the duke sold the abbacy for one
hundred and forty-five marks of silver to a certain Robert, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
wicked monk of Saint-Denis, who like a devouring wolf drove
out the monks, built a stronghold in the sacred precincts of the
monastery, and garrisoned it with armed retainers whom he
hired out of profits derived from the sale of ecclesiastical ornaments
belonging to the abbey.<a name="FNanchor_693" id="FNanchor_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_693" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>More notorious still, and more fatal to the good name of the
duke, was the situation which arose in the bishopric of Lisieux
upon the death of Gilbert Maminot in August 1101. At first
Ranulf Flambard, the notorious bishop of Durham, succeeded in
gaining the vacant see for his brother Fulcher, who, in spite of his
illiteracy, had some commendable qualities; and since he lived
but a few months after his consecration, no active protest was
raised against him.<a name="FNanchor_694" id="FNanchor_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> But upon his death, Flambard resorted to
a more scandalous measure and obtained the see for his son
Thomas, a youth some twelve years of age.<a name="FNanchor_695" id="FNanchor_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> The duke invested
the boy with the sacred office, at the same time agreeing that, if
he should die, another of Flambard’s sons, who was still younger,
should succeed to the bishopric.<a name="FNanchor_696" id="FNanchor_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> And meanwhile Flambard
himself administered the affairs of the see, “not as bishop but as
steward.”<a name="FNanchor_697" id="FNanchor_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>So matters stood for some three years, until in 1105 the great
canonist and reformer, Ivo of Chartres, intervened, and through
his immense influence elevated what had hitherto been but a flagrant
local abuse into an affair of something like European importance.
He wrote to the Norman bishops demanding that they
put an end to such a scandal.<a name="FNanchor_698" id="FNanchor_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> Meanwhile, the serious danger in
which Robert Curthose stood of losing his duchy brought him for
a moment to his senses, and, at the urgent warning of the archbishop
of Rouen and of the bishop of Évreux, he had Flambard
and his sons ejected from the see, and gave orders for a canonical
election.<a name="FNanchor_699" id="FNanchor_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> The choice of the clergy fell upon William, archdeacon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
of Évreux, a worthy man, who went at once to the metropolitan
and demanded consecration;<a name="FNanchor_700" id="FNanchor_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> and Ivo of Chartres wrote to
congratulate the Norman bishops upon having purged the
church of the ‘dirty boys’ who had been thrust into the sacred
office.<a name="FNanchor_701" id="FNanchor_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> But now new complications arose. It so happened that
William Bonne-Ame, archbishop of Rouen, was then under sentence
of excommunication, and therefore incompetent to install
the new bishop elect. Accordingly, the latter wrote Bishop Ivo to
inquire whether under the circumstances he might legitimately
receive consecration from the suffragans of the excommunicated
archbishop. Ivo confessed himself unable to answer the question,
and referred the bishop elect to Rome to deal directly with the
Holy See.<a name="FNanchor_702" id="FNanchor_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>During this unexpected delay, Flambard executed another
‘tergiversation.’ He induced the duke, in return for a great sum,
to confer the bishopric upon one of his clerks, a certain William de
Pacy.<a name="FNanchor_703" id="FNanchor_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> Again the venerable Ivo wrote to the archbishop of
Rouen and the bishop of Évreux to protest against this new introduction
of uncleanness into the church which they had so
recently purged, and to warn them that unless they acted with
vigor to correct this latest abuse, he would bring the “filthy,
fetid rumor to the apostolic ears” to their no small disadvantage.<a name="FNanchor_704" id="FNanchor_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_704" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
The threat was not without avail. William de Pacy was
summoned to Rouen to answer before the metropolitan for his
conduct, and was able to make no defence. He freely admitted
that he had received the bishopric neither by election of clergy
and people nor by the free gift of the duke. Judgment upon him,
however, was suspended—perhaps because the archbishop was
still under sentence of excommunication—and he was sent to
Rome, there to be condemned for simony.<a name="FNanchor_705" id="FNanchor_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> Bishop Ivo wrote to
the Pope setting forth in detail the whole course of the disgraceful
business.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>But now Ivo of Chartres went a step farther. He had put the
full weight of the great moral influence which he exerted in Europe
upon the Norman bishops. He had laid the scandal of Lisieux
before the Pope. He now turned his gaze across the English
Channel. Writing to Robert of Meulan, King Henry’s trusted
minister, he again protested against the disgraceful intrusion of
Ranulf Flambard into the see of Lisieux. He urged him to use his
well known influence with the king to induce him to do whatever
he could for the liberation of the oppressed church, lest those who
had welcomed Henry’s intervention in the affairs of Normandy,
and had predicted that good would come of it, “should willy-nilly
change the serenity of their praise into clouds of vituperation.”
“For,” said he, “kings are not instituted that they may
break the laws, but that, if the destroyers of laws cannot otherwise
be corrected, they may strike them down with the sword.”<a name="FNanchor_706" id="FNanchor_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_706" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
Could even a more scrupulous monarch than Henry I have
resisted such a call to arms?<a name="FNanchor_707" id="FNanchor_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_707" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>As a returned crusader, Robert Curthose might possibly have
looked to the Holy See for some support against his enemies.
Indeed, he had done so. Before embarking upon the invasion of
England in 1101, he had written to the Pope complaining that
Henry had violated his oath in assuming the English crown; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
Pascal had felt constrained to write Anselm a mild letter<a name="FNanchor_708" id="FNanchor_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> in
which he recognized the special obligations of the papacy to one
who had labored “in the liberation of the church of Asia.” He
asked Anselm to join with the legates he was sending in mediating
between the warring brothers, ‘unless peace had already been
made between them.’<a name="FNanchor_709" id="FNanchor_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> But at best this was only a perfunctory
and belated recognition of an inconvenient obligation, and Pascal
can hardly have seriously expected to influence the situation in
Duke Robert’s favor.</p>

<p>And as time elapsed, the attitude of Pascal did not become more
favorable to the duke. In the summer of 1105 the relations between
the papacy and Henry I suddenly improved greatly, and
from that time rapid progress was made towards a definite settlement
of the investiture controversy in England.<a name="FNanchor_710" id="FNanchor_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> This removed
the last possible consideration which might have induced the Pope
to support the duke against the king in Normandy. Moreover, a
fragment of Pascal’s correspondence with Robert Curthose, which
has recently been brought to light,<a name="FNanchor_711" id="FNanchor_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> reveals the fact that at this
very time the Pope was engaged in an investiture struggle with
the duke. We would gladly know more of this controversy, but
this single surviving letter is enough to show that the Pope had
complained that, contrary to the law of the church, Robert was
performing investitures with staff and ring; that, treating the
church not as the spouse of Christ but as a handmaiden, he was
giving her over to be ruled by usurping enemies. Probably
Pascal referred to the notorious scandals of Lisieux and of Saint-Pierre-sur-Dives.
Something also of the duke’s reply may be
gathered from the papal letter. Taking his stand upon the rights
and customs of his ancestors, he had boldly claimed for himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
the right of investiture. This was sound ducal policy, but it
would not be accepted in Rome from such a prince as Robert
Curthose. It could only serve to complete the breach between the
ex-crusader and the Holy See and leave the duke without support
in his hour of need.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in what striking contrast with the weak and
blundering policy of Robert Curthose, were the careful, methodical
preparations which Henry I was making for the struggle
upon which he had determined! With him all was wisdom, foresight,
largeness of view, self-control.</p>

<p>The friendly relations between the courts of France and England,
established at the beginning of Henry’s reign by the state
visit of Louis, the king designate of France, have already been
remarked upon.<a name="FNanchor_712" id="FNanchor_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_712" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> Henry I took good care to preserve and cultivate
this diplomatic cordiality during the critical years of his
struggle for Normandy. And, as will appear in the sequel, his
efforts were abundantly rewarded when Prince Louis officially
recognized his conquest of the duchy shortly after it was completed.<a name="FNanchor_713" id="FNanchor_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_713" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
In the same spirit the king prepared for all eventualities
on the side of Flanders. In the archives of the English exchequer
there has been preserved an original chirograph of a treaty which
he concluded, apparently in 1103, with Count Robert of Flanders.<a name="FNanchor_714" id="FNanchor_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_714" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
By its terms the count bound himself, in exchange for an
annual subsidy of four hundred marks, to furnish the king with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
force of a thousand knights—for service in Normandy, among
other places, be it noted—and to do his utmost to dissuade the
king of France from any attack upon the king of England.
Further, as the decisive struggle approached, Henry entered into
agreements with the princes of Maine, Anjou, and Brittany for
contingents to be furnished from those regions to his army for the
conquest of Normandy. The record of the negotiations has not
been preserved; but we shall meet with these contingents rendering
effective service in the campaigns of 1105 and 1106.<a name="FNanchor_715" id="FNanchor_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>But Henry prepared himself against the duke not only by the
careful manipulation of his relations with foreign powers; he
spared no effort to undermine him in the duchy. His intervention
in the war of the Breteuil succession and the marriage of
his daughter Juliana to Eustace of Breteuil have already been
alluded to.<a name="FNanchor_716" id="FNanchor_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> A similar purpose must have prompted him to
arrange the marriage of another of his natural daughters to Rotrou
of Mortagne,<a name="FNanchor_717" id="FNanchor_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> one of the chief enemies of Robert of Bellême,
and an old companion in arms of Robert Curthose on the Crusade.
Some hint, at least, of the nature of the pacification which Robert
of Meulan was intended to make when he was sent to Normandy
as the king’s special agent in 1103 may be gathered from the efforts
which he made to procure the liberation of the ‘avaricious
usurer,’ John of Meulan.<a name="FNanchor_718" id="FNanchor_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> It can hardly be doubted that Henry
was making free use of money in the corruption of the duke’s
influential subjects and in the upbuilding of an English party in
Normandy. And in this policy he was very successful. Not only
were important Norman churchmen imploring his aid and working
for his intervention; but many great nobles were either openly
or secretly deserting the duke and offering their services to the
English cause. The movement is well illustrated by the case of
Ralph III of Conches. His father, Ralph II, had been among
the Norman barons who upon the death of William Rufus had
taken up arms and plundered the lands of Robert of Meulan
at Beaumont.<a name="FNanchor_719" id="FNanchor_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_719" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> He was certainly no friend of Henry I. But upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
his death, probably in 1102,<a name="FNanchor_720" id="FNanchor_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> his son saw new light. Crossing to
England, he was cordially welcomed by the king, who granted
him his father’s lands and the hand of an English heiress who was
connected with the royal family.<a name="FNanchor_721" id="FNanchor_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> Such a shining example was
not lost upon other Norman barons who now deserted the duke
and besought King Henry ‘with tears’ to come to the aid of the
suffering church and of their wretched country.<a name="FNanchor_722" id="FNanchor_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_722" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>By the beginning of 1104, Henry I had acquired a strong party,
both lay and ecclesiastical, in Normandy, which eagerly awaited
his coming and stood ready to aid him in the overthrow of Robert
Curthose and in the conquest of the duchy. He had never given
up Domfront, and he apparently retained possession of certain
strongholds in the Cotentin,<a name="FNanchor_723" id="FNanchor_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> the treaty of Alton notwithstanding.
Upon these he could rely as a secure base while his friends
rallied around him after he had landed on Norman soil. Henry’s
diplomacy, however, could not remove all enemies from his path,
and he sometimes chose to defy them. William of Mortain, earl
of Cornwall, had been among the duke’s most powerful supporters
against the king in 1101. Yet, for some unexplained reason, he
did not suffer the prompt banishment to which the Bellêmes and
other traitors were condemned when the crisis of the invasion had
passed. The king temporized and kept up at least an appearance
of friendship. It is even intimated that in 1104 he sent the earl to
Normandy to act on his behalf. However this may be, when
William of Mortain arrived in Normandy, he worked against the
king rather than for him, and, as a result, was promptly deprived
of all his English honors.<a name="FNanchor_724" id="FNanchor_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_724" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> The duke had gained at least one
supporter who would not desert him.</p>

<p>The year 1104 was for Henry I a period of active preparation
for an enterprise which he was not yet ready publicly to avow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
His trusted agents were busy in Normandy preparing the way
with English treasure. Gradually and quietly he was sending men
and equipment to reënforce the garrisons of his Norman strongholds.<a name="FNanchor_725" id="FNanchor_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_725" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>
Indeed, if Ordericus Vitalis can be trusted,<a name="FNanchor_726" id="FNanchor_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_726" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> Henry himself
crossed the Channel with a fleet and paid a visit to Domfront
and his castles in Normandy in great state, and was welcomed by
Robert of Meulan, Richard earl of Chester, Stephen of Aumale,
Henry of Eu, Rotrou of Mortagne, Robert Fitz Hamon, Robert
de Montfort, Ralph de Mortimer, and many others who held
estates in England and were ready to support him in an attack
upon the duchy. The list shows strikingly the proportions to
which the English party in Normandy had grown. Encouraged
by his enthusiastic reception, the king is said to have taken a lofty
tone in his dealings with the duke. He summoned him to a conference
and lectured him upon his incompetence. Again, as the
year before in England, he upbraided him for making peace with
Robert of Bellême and for granting to him the domains of the
Conqueror, contrary to their agreements. He charged him with
abetting highwaymen and brigands, and with dissipating the
wealth of his duchy upon the impudent scamps and hangers-on
who surrounded him. He declared him neither a real prince nor a
shepherd of his people, since he suffered the defenceless population
to remain a prey to ravening wolves. This eloquent indictment,
we are told, quite overwhelmed the duke. Though he
placed the blame for his misdeeds upon his turbulent associates,
he craved the king’s pardon and offered to compensate him by
surrendering the homage of William of Évreux together with his
county and his vassals. Henry accepted the offer, William of
Évreux agreed, and a formal transfer of the homage was effected,
the duke placing the count’s hands between the hands of the
king. And with this reward for his pains, Henry returned to
England “before winter,” doubtless more than ever convinced of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
the weakness of Robert Curthose and of the feasibility of his
overthrow and of the conquest of the duchy.<a name="FNanchor_727" id="FNanchor_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_727" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>Henry’s visit had given a further shock to the duke’s prestige,
and his return to England was followed by a renewed outbreak of
anarchy and disorder in the duchy. Robert of Bellême and William
of Mortain, in high indignation at the new advantages which
the king had gained, began to attack his adherents, and such was
the harrying and burning and wholesale murder which ensued that
many of the unarmed peasants fled into France with their wives
and children.<a name="FNanchor_728" id="FNanchor_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> Robert Fitz Hamon, lord of Torigny and Creully,
one of the duke’s chief supporters in 1101, had thrown in his lot
with the king, and his treason against the duke had been of so
black a character as to render him particularly odious among
loyal subjects and to arouse intense indignation against him. He
now took to plundering the countryside, and as he was harrying
the Bessin, Gontier d’Aunay and Reginald of Warenne with the
forces from Bayeux and Caen managed to cut him off and surround
him in the village of Secqueville. He sought refuge in the
church tower, but the sanctuary did not protect him; for the
church was burned, and he was taken prisoner. As his captors
led him away to Bayeux, they had great difficulty to keep him
from the hands of the mob which crowded after them, shouting</p>

<p>Such were the chaotic conditions in Normandy as they are
depicted for us in the spring of 1105. Yet we should beware of
exaggeration. They may not have been general. Indeed, they
probably were not. Our evidence, at best, is but fragmentary,
and it rests in the main upon the testimony of Ordericus Vitalis,
who was no friend of Robert Curthose, and who dwelt in the
debatable region of the south, where the lawless elements were
most unbridled, and where the disturbing influence of English
aggression had made most headway. Even though we accept at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
its face value the testimony concerning the diocese of Séez, the
Bessin, and the Cotentin, it seems reasonable, in the absence of
such evidence for other parts of the duchy, to conclude that
conditions elsewhere were almost certainly better.</p>

<p>It is impossible to form anything like a complete picture of the
state of the defences of the duchy upon the eve of the English
invasion. Robert of Bellême and William of Mortain, by far
the most powerful of the duke’s supporters, were still in undisputed
possession of their hereditary Norman dominions. Robert
d’Estouteville had charge of the duke’s troops and castles in the
pays de Caux.<a name="FNanchor_730" id="FNanchor_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_730" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> Hugh de Nonant was in command at Rouen.<a name="FNanchor_731" id="FNanchor_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_731" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>
His nephew Gontier d’Aunay was charged with the defence of
Bayeux;<a name="FNanchor_732" id="FNanchor_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_732" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> and, apparently, Enguerran, son of Ilbert de Lacy,
with that of Caen.<a name="FNanchor_733" id="FNanchor_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_733" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> Others of the duke’s chief supporters were
Reginald of Warenne,<a name="FNanchor_734" id="FNanchor_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_734" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> brother of the earl of Surrey, and William
of Conversano,<a name="FNanchor_735" id="FNanchor_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> brother of the late Duchess Sibyl. The ducal
forces were evidently too weak to offer effectual resistance in the
open. Robert’s hope lay in the strength of his fortresses; and it
appears that he made a spirited effort to put them in a state of
defence, though his financial resources were near exhaustion.
Wace is specific with regard to the works which were undertaken

trenches which had been dug</p>

<p class="noindent">and which was connected with the waters of the Orne. So long as
the duke could raise money by laying taxes upon the burgesses,
he hired mercenaries, and for the rest he made promises. But his
exactions only served to stir up the townsmen against him, without
being in any way adequate to keep his forces together. In a
steady stream they deserted to the king, and the helpless duke
could only remark characteristically:</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Henry I, having fitted out his expedition for the
invasion of Normandy, crossed the Channel in Holy Week 1105,<a name="FNanchor_737" id="FNanchor_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_737" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>
and landed without opposition at Barfleur in the Cotentin; and
on Easter eve he found quarters in the village of Carentan.<a name="FNanchor_738" id="FNanchor_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>Then, according to the account of Ordericus Vitalis, there followed
an amazing piece of acting. The venerable Serlo, bishop of
Séez, “first of the Normans to offer his services to the king,”
came to Carentan to celebrate Easter in the royal presence.
Clothing himself in his sacred vestments, he entered the church.
And while he sat awaiting the assembling of the people and of the
king’s followers before beginning the service, he observed that the
church was filled with all sorts of chests and utensils and various
kinds of gear which the peasants had brought in for protection
from the war and anarchy which were devastating the Cotentin.
It was probably in the main from pillage by the king’s forces that
the frightened peasantry were seeking protection,<a name="FNanchor_739" id="FNanchor_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_739" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> but this fact
did not prevent the facile bishop from making the scene before
him his point of departure for a ringing appeal to arms, and for a
public justification of Henry’s attack upon Normandy. Observing
the king with a group of his nobles seated humbly among the
peasants’ panniers at the lower end of the church, Serlo heaved a
deep sigh for the misery of the people and rose to speak.</p>

<p>The hearts of all the faithful, he said, should mourn for the distresses
of the church and for the wretchedness of the people. The
Cotentin was laid waste and depopulated. For lack of a governor
all Normandy was a prey to thieves and robbers. The church of
God, which ought to be a place of prayer, was now, for want of a
righteous defender, turned into a storehouse for the peasants’
belongings. There was no room left in which to kneel reverently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
or to stand devoutly before the Divine Majesty because of the
clutter of goods which the helpless rustics for fear of plunderers
had brought into the Lord’s house. And so, where government
failed, the church had perforce become the refuge of a defenceless
people. Yet not even in the church was there security; for that
very year, in Serlo’s own diocese of Séez, Robert of Bellême had
burned the church of Tournay to the ground, and men and
women to the number of forty-five had perished in it. Robert,
the king’s brother, did not really possess the duchy or rule his
people as a duke who walked in the path of justice. He was an
indolent and an abandoned prince, who had made himself subservient
to William of Conversano, Hugh de Nonant, and Gontier
d’Aunay. He had dissipated the wealth of his fair duchy in
vanity and upon trifles. Often he fasted till three in the afternoon
for lack of bread. Often he dared not rise from bed and
attend mass for want of trousers, stockings, and shoes; for the
buffoons and harlots who infested his quarters had carried them
off during the night while he lay snoring in drunkenness; and
then they impudently boasted that they had robbed the duke.
So, the head languishing, the whole body was sick, and a prince
without understanding had placed the whole duchy in peril. Let
the king arise, therefore, in God’s name, and obtain his paternal
inheritance with the sword of justice. Let him snatch his ancestral
possessions from the hands of base men. Let him give rein to
his righteous anger, as did David of old, not from any worldly
desire for territorial aggrandizement, but for the defence of his
‘native soil.’<a name="FNanchor_740" id="FNanchor_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_740" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>Moved by this stirring appeal, the king gravely arose. “In the
Lord’s name,” he said, “I will rise to this labor for the sake of
peace, and with your aid I will seek peace for the church.”
Robert of Meulan and other barons present applauded the
momentous decision.</p>

<p>And now, behold another wonder! King Henry had become
the defender of the church. In order that his virtue might appear
the more transcendent, he was now to join the ranks of the reformers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
of morals. The venerable Serlo, resuming his discourse,
proceeded to harangue the king and his suite upon the evils of the
outlandish fashions which had recently been taken up in high
society, to the great scandal of the clergy and of decent Christians.
Like obdurate sons of Belial, the men of fashion had taken
to dressing their hair like women and to wearing things like
scorpion’s tails at the extremities of their feet, so that they resembled
women because of their effeminacy, and serpents by
reason of their pointed fangs. This kind of men had been foretold
a thousand years before by St. John the Divine, under the
figure of locusts. Let the king offer his subjects a laudable
example, in order that they might see in his person a model by
which to regulate their own.</p>

<p>Again Henry was convinced by episcopal eloquence and readily
assented to Serlo’s proposal. The bishop had come prepared.
Amid a general consternation which may well be imagined, he
drew shears from his wallet and proceeded to crop the royal
locks. Robert of Meulan was the next victim to be sacrificed to
the bishop’s reforming zeal. And by this time the rest of the
royal household and the congregation, anticipating a positive
order from the king, began to vie with one another as to which
should be shorn first; and soon they were trampling under foot as
vile refuse the locks which a few moments before they had
cherished as their most precious possessions.<a name="FNanchor_741" id="FNanchor_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_741" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>The reader may, perhaps, be left to judge for himself as to the
amount of credibility to be attached to the highly colored and
obviously strongly prejudiced narrative of Ordericus Vitalis
which has here been paraphrased. It clearly has a significance of
its own, quite apart from the question of strict historical veracity.
The speech of Bishop Serlo, as we have it, is, of course, not his at
all, but a literary creation of the monk of Saint-Évroul. Yet it
must pretty faithfully represent the contemporary point of view
of the Norman clergy and of royal apologists generally. It sets
forth the king’s ‘platform,’ to borrow a very modern term, and
contains the grounds on which contemporaries attempted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
justify what was in reality an unjustifiable act of aggression.
Moreover, in spite of much imaginary coloring, there must be a
certain residuum of truth in Ordericus’s narrative, which illustrates
again in a striking manner the extreme care and almost
endless detail with which Henry I prepared his way for the conquest
of Normandy. In spite of the mediaeval trappings, there
is something almost modern about this elaborate attempt to
manipulate public opinion and to crystallize a party. Further, it
is not a little significant that the Easter scene at Carentan could
have been enacted at all. That Henry should have been able to
land an invading army at Barfleur, advance without opposition to
an unprotected village, and there delay at will in all security, is a
striking proof of the defenceless condition of the duchy. The
duke’s sole reliance was in his strongholds. There is no evidence
that he had any force assembled to oppose the invader in the
open.</p>

<p>King Henry had no need to hurry. While he delayed at Carentan,
his supporters in Normandy rallied around him, and his
forces gained greatly in strength. His landing at Barfleur had
been the signal for further desertions among the duke’s vassals.
English gold and silver were all-powerful.<a name="FNanchor_742" id="FNanchor_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_742" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> Wace says the king
had ‘bushels’ of the precious treasure. He carried it about with
him in ‘hogsheads’ loaded upon carts, and by its judicious distribution
among barons, castellans, and doughty warriors, he
readily persuaded them to desert their lord the duke.<a name="FNanchor_743" id="FNanchor_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_743" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> Meanwhile,
Henry sent envoys to King Philip of France,<a name="FNanchor_744" id="FNanchor_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_744" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> and summoned
his allies, Geoffrey Martel and Helias of La Flèche, to join
him with their Angevins and Manceaux.<a name="FNanchor_745" id="FNanchor_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_745" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>The military events of the campaign which followed are obscure,
and can be traced with little chronological certainty. We
hear of some sort of hostile encounter at Maromme near Rouen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
shortly after Easter, but we know nothing about it, save that a
certain knight in the service of Robert d’Estouteville was slain.<a name="FNanchor_746" id="FNanchor_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_746" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>
The chief military undertaking of the campaign was undoubtedly
the siege of Bayeux. Against Bayeux and its commander, Gontier
d’Aunay, the king had a particular grievance because of the
capture and imprisonment of his supporter Robert Fitz Hamon.<a name="FNanchor_747" id="FNanchor_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_747" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>
Accordingly, he assembled all his forces, including his allies from
Maine and Anjou, and laid siege to Bayeux.<a name="FNanchor_748" id="FNanchor_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_748" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> Gontier d’Aunay
went out to meet him and promptly handed over his prisoner,
Robert Fitz Hamon. He declined, however, to make any further
concessions, and Henry refused to raise the siege.<a name="FNanchor_749" id="FNanchor_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_749" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> But the
garrison failed to justify the confidence which their commander
had placed in them,<a name="FNanchor_750" id="FNanchor_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_750" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> and, in an assault, Henry managed to fire
the city.<a name="FNanchor_751" id="FNanchor_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_751" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> A high wind carried the flames from roof to roof, and
soon the whole place was swept by the conflagration. Bishop
Odo’s beautiful cathedral and several other churches, the house
of the canons attached to the cathedral, the house of a distinguished
citizen named Conan, almost all the buildings in the
town, in fact, except a few poor huts, were destroyed. Many of
the inhabitants, who in their terror had fled to the cathedral,
perished in the flames. The place was given over to be plundered
by the Manceaux and the Angevins, and Gontier d’Aunay
and many of the garrison were taken captive.<a name="FNanchor_752" id="FNanchor_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_752" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>Caen was the next important place to fall into Henry’s hands;
but here no siege was necessary. The fate of Bayeux had spread
consternation throughout the duchy, and served as a terrible
warning of what might be expected, if resistance proved unsuccessful;
and the burgesses of Caen had little love for the duke,
who had made them feel the weight of his exactions. Accordingly,
a conspiracy was formed among certain of the leading citizens,
Enguerran de Lacy and the ducal garrison were expelled, and
the town was basely surrendered to the English, to the intense
indignation of the common people, among whom the duke appears
to have been popular.<a name="FNanchor_753" id="FNanchor_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_753" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> Robert Curthose was himself in Caen at
the time, and, learning of the plot at the last moment, he fled
headlong to the Hiémois. His attendants, who followed closely
after him, were held up at the gate, and his baggage was rifled.<a name="FNanchor_754" id="FNanchor_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_754" class="fnanchor">[115]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
In grateful appreciation of this easy conquest, the king conferred
the manor of Dallington, in England, upon the wealthy burgesses
who had betrayed the second town of Normandy into his
hands.<a name="FNanchor_755" id="FNanchor_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_755" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>Having gained possession of Bayeux and Caen, the king
marched upon the strong castle of Falaise. But at this moment
he temporarily lost the powerful support of the count of Maine.
“At the request of the Normans,” it is not said of what Normans,
Helias of La Flèche withdrew from the contest; and Henry found
his forces so weakened that he was obliged to abandon the attack
upon Falaise until the following year. Some desultory fighting
occurred, however, in which one of the king’s knights, Roger of
Gloucester, was mortally wounded by a shaft from a crossbow.<a name="FNanchor_756" id="FNanchor_756"></a><a href="#Footnote_756" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>
Almost simultaneously, apparently, with the operations about
Falaise, Robert and Henry attempted to make peace. In the
week of Pentecost (21-28 May), they met in conference at the
village of Cintheaux near Falaise and endeavored for two days to
arrive at an agreement. But the king was prepared to offer no
terms which the duke could accept, and the negotiations were
broken off.<a name="FNanchor_757" id="FNanchor_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_757" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p>There was, indeed, no good reason why Henry should have
made peace, except to gain time while he reëquipped himself for
the completion of the enterprise upon which he had embarked.
The sources speak specifically only of the conquest of Bayeux
and of Caen during the campaign of 1105. Yet it is certain that
the extension of the king’s domination through the influence of
English gold and through the voluntary surrender of numerous
minor strongholds had gone much further than this.<a name="FNanchor_758" id="FNanchor_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_758" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> Eadmer,
writing of the situation as he himself saw it in Normandy in July<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
1105, was able to say that almost all Normandy had been subjected
to the king. The power of the duke had been reduced to
such a point that hardly any one obeyed him or rendered him the
respect due to a prince. Almost all the barons spurned his
authority and betrayed the fealty which they owed him, while
they ran after the king’s gold and silver and surrendered towns
and castles on every side.<a name="FNanchor_759" id="FNanchor_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_759" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> Yet with all his success, Henry was
unable to complete the conquest of Normandy in a single campaign.
Even hogsheads may be drained, and the method of waging
war with gold and silver, as well as with the sword, had been
costly. Before completing his task, he found it necessary to
return to England and replenish his supplies.<a name="FNanchor_760" id="FNanchor_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_760" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>But before returning to England, Henry had a diplomatic problem
of great importance to solve. Since 1103 Anselm had been
living in exile, and the investiture controversy had been in abeyance.
But the archbishop had at last grown restive and had
decided to resort to the extreme measure of excommunicating the
king. Rumor of the impending sentence spread throughout
France, England, and Normandy, and caused not a little uneasiness.<a name="FNanchor_761" id="FNanchor_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_761" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>
In the midst of his struggle for Normandy with Robert
Curthose, Henry could not but view this new danger with grave
concern; and he never showed to better advantage than in the
broad and statesmanlike way in which he met the crisis. Through
the mediation of Ivo of Chartres and of the king’s sister, Countess
Adela of Blois, a conference was arranged between him and the
archbishop, to be held on 22 July at Laigle on the Norman
frontier. There he received Anselm with the utmost courtesy,
and, since he was in no position to drive matters to a rupture, he
showed himself sincerely desirous of arriving at an amicable
adjustment. Anselm, too, was disposed to compromise; and
they were soon able to agree upon the broad lines of a final settlement
of the long controversy. Messengers were despatched to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
Rome by both the king and the archbishop to secure the ratification
of the Holy See.<a name="FNanchor_762" id="FNanchor_762"></a><a href="#Footnote_762" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> The details of a formal concordat had yet
to be arranged; but friendly relations were now completely restored
between Henry and Anselm, and the ecclesiastical crisis
was averted. In August<a name="FNanchor_763" id="FNanchor_763"></a><a href="#Footnote_763" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> the king returned to England, “and
what he had won in Normandy continued afterwards in peace and
obedient to him, except those who dwelt anywhere near Count
William of Mortain.”<a name="FNanchor_764" id="FNanchor_764"></a><a href="#Footnote_764" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>In point of fact, William of Mortain and Robert of Bellême
appear to have been almost the only really powerful barons in
Normandy who still supported the duke, and the loyalty even of
the Bellême interests could probably have been shaken had the
king so desired. Before Christmas Robert of Bellême paid a visit
to England and sought an interview with the king. It would be
hazardous to infer that he, too, was contemplating a desertion of
the ducal cause; but whatever his mission, he failed to accomplish
it, and, departing from the king’s Christmas court ‘unreconciled,’
he returned to Normandy.<a name="FNanchor_765" id="FNanchor_765"></a><a href="#Footnote_765" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>It was not long before the king had a more important visitor
from beyond the sea. Early in 1106 Robert Curthose himself
crossed the Channel, and, in an interview with the king at Northampton,
besought him to restore the conquests which he had won
from him in Normandy.<a name="FNanchor_766" id="FNanchor_766"></a><a href="#Footnote_766" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> The duke must have felt his situation
almost desperate, yet it is difficult to imagine what inducements
he expected to offer, or how, in the light of his past experience, he
could have dreamed of gaining a concession or any consideration
from his unscrupulous brother. Henry could well afford to be
obdurate, and he returned a flat refusal to the duke’s demands.
Robert withdrew in anger, and returned to his duchy;<a name="FNanchor_767" id="FNanchor_767"></a><a href="#Footnote_767" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
Henry wrote immediately to Anselm, who was still in Normandy,
announcing his own crossing for 3 May following. It is not quite
easy to see why he should have stated in his letter that Robert
had parted with him amicably,<a name="FNanchor_768" id="FNanchor_768"></a><a href="#Footnote_768" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> but the ways of diplomacy are
often obscure.</p>

<p>Robert Curthose now knew beyond all question what he had to
expect, and, as formerly in the crisis of his struggle with William
Rufus, he sought aid from without. If the unsupported statement
of William of Malmesbury may be accepted, he appealed to his
overlord, the king of France, and to Robert of Flanders in a conference
at Rouen;<a name="FNanchor_769" id="FNanchor_769"></a><a href="#Footnote_769" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> but the far-seeing diplomacy of Henry I had
anticipated him,<a name="FNanchor_770" id="FNanchor_770"></a><a href="#Footnote_770" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> and he was able to obtain no assistance.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Henry had completed his preparations for a second
invasion of Normandy, and “before August”<a name="FNanchor_771" id="FNanchor_771"></a><a href="#Footnote_771" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> he crossed the
Channel. He landed without opposition, but soon afterwards,
apparently, an attempt was made to take him in an ambush.
Abbot Robert of Saint-Pierre-sur-Dives, the notorious simoniac,
entered into a secret compact with the duke and some of his
barons at Falaise to betray the king into their hands. Then,
while Reginald of Warenne and the younger Robert d’Estouteville,
with a considerable body of knights, installed themselves in
the fortress which the abbot had constructed within the precincts
of his monastery, he paid a visit to the king at Caen and treacherously
agreed to surrender the fortress to him, at the same time
advising him to come quietly with but a few knights to take it,
in order to avoid giving the alarm. But Henry did not ride
blindly into the trap that was set for him. Placing himself at the
head of a force of seven hundred horse, he came suddenly upon the
monastery at daybreak after an all night’s ride; and, as soon as
he had apprised himself of the true situation, he launched an instant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
attack, burned both the monastery and the fortress, and
took Reginald of Warenne, Robert d’Estouteville, and many of
their men captive. Reënforcements on their way from Falaise
saw the conflagration and turned back in flight. The attempted
ambush had been turned into a notable royal victory. The
treacherous Abbot Robert was also taken. Thrown across a horse
‘like a sack,’ he was brought before the king, who expelled him
from the land with the declaration that, if it were not for his
sacred orders, he would have him torn limb from limb.<a name="FNanchor_772" id="FNanchor_772"></a><a href="#Footnote_772" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p>As we have noted, the duke’s power was in the main confined to
scattered strongholds such as Falaise and Rouen.<a name="FNanchor_773" id="FNanchor_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_773" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> Through the
open country Henry was able to move about practically at will.
He went to Bec and had a cordial interview with Anselm (15
August). Much progress had been made towards the settlement
of the investiture controversy since their meeting at Laigle the
year before, and they were now completely reconciled. Anselm
returned to England disposed to give the king his full support.<a name="FNanchor_774" id="FNanchor_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_774" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>
Every moral obstacle now seemed removed from Henry’s path.<a name="FNanchor_775" id="FNanchor_775"></a><a href="#Footnote_775" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, or soon after,<a name="FNanchor_776" id="FNanchor_776"></a><a href="#Footnote_776" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> the king began operations against
the castle of Tinchebray. Adopting the well known expedient of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
the siegecraft of the period, he erected a counter fortress against
the place, and installed in it Thomas de Saint-Jean with a garrison
of knights and foot soldiers. Thereupon William of Mortain,
lord of Tinchebray, collected forces which were more than a
match for Thomas de Saint-Jean and his men, and threw food
and necessary supplies into the stronghold.<a name="FNanchor_777" id="FNanchor_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_777" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> But by this time
the king had been powerfully reënforced with auxiliary troops
from Maine and Brittany, under the command of Helias of La
Flèche and of Alan Fergant,<a name="FNanchor_778" id="FNanchor_778"></a><a href="#Footnote_778" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> and he began the siege of Tinchebray
in earnest.<a name="FNanchor_779" id="FNanchor_779"></a><a href="#Footnote_779" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p>Robert Curthose, now reduced to desperate straits, and urged
on by the importunity of William of Mortain,<a name="FNanchor_780" id="FNanchor_780"></a><a href="#Footnote_780" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> decided to stake
all on the issue of a battle in the open.<a name="FNanchor_781" id="FNanchor_781"></a><a href="#Footnote_781" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> Collecting all his forces,
he marched upon Tinchebray and challenged the king to raise the
siege or prepare for battle.<a name="FNanchor_782" id="FNanchor_782"></a><a href="#Footnote_782" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> Again, as at Alton in 1101, the two
brothers stood facing one another, about to engage in a fratricidal
struggle. But again there were negotiations. Certain
men of religion, the venerable hermit Vitalis among them, intervened
to prevent the conflict.<a name="FNanchor_783" id="FNanchor_783"></a><a href="#Footnote_783" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> The king, as always, was careful
to justify himself before the public eye; and, if we can trust our
authority, he offered terms of peace. Protesting loudly that he
was actuated by no worldly ambition, but only by a desire to
succor the poor and to protect the suffering church, he proposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
that the duke surrender to him all the castles in Normandy and
the whole financial and judicial administration of the duchy, reserving
for himself one half of the revenues. Henry, on his side,
would undertake to pay the duke, out of the English treasury, an
annual subsidy equal to the other half of the Norman revenues;
and, for the future, Robert might revel in feasts and games and
all delights, in perfect security and in freedom from all care.
Such terms, if indeed they were ever really proposed, were in
themselves an insult. And, moreover, the duke had already had
bitter experience of Henry’s devotion to treaties. The monk of
Saint-Évroul, therefore, becomes quite incredible when he would
have us believe that Robert laid these proposals seriously before
his council, and insinuates that he was inclined to accede to them.
In any case, the duke’s supporters rejected them with violent
language, and negotiations were broken off.<a name="FNanchor_784" id="FNanchor_784"></a><a href="#Footnote_784" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> Both sides now
prepared for battle.</p>

<p>The sources are by no means clear, or in perfect accord, as to the
exact disposition of the forces in the battle of Tinchebray; but the
general plan of the engagement is clear,<a name="FNanchor_785" id="FNanchor_785"></a><a href="#Footnote_785" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> as is also the very considerable
numerical superiority which the king enjoyed.<a name="FNanchor_786" id="FNanchor_786"></a><a href="#Footnote_786" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> The
forces on either side were composed of both mounted knights and
foot soldiers;<a name="FNanchor_787" id="FNanchor_787"></a><a href="#Footnote_787" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> and, so far as it is possible to say from the evidence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
they were arranged in columns of successive divisions,
called <i>acies</i>, drawn up one behind another.<a name="FNanchor_788" id="FNanchor_788"></a><a href="#Footnote_788" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> William of Mortain
commanded the vanguard of the ducal forces, and Robert of Bellême
the rear.<a name="FNanchor_789" id="FNanchor_789"></a><a href="#Footnote_789" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> It is not clear what position the duke held in the
battle formation.<a name="FNanchor_790" id="FNanchor_790"></a><a href="#Footnote_790" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> Our information as to the disposition of the
royal forces is fuller, but confusing. The first division, or <i>acies</i>,
was composed in the main of foot soldiers from the Bessin, the
Avranchin, and the Cotentin—probably under the command of
Ranulf of Bayeux<a name="FNanchor_791" id="FNanchor_791"></a><a href="#Footnote_791" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>—but they were supported by a considerable
body of mounted knights. The second division, under the
immediate command of King Henry, was likewise made up of
both mounted knights and men fighting on foot, the latter in this
case being the king in person and a considerable number of his
barons who had dismounted in order to give greater stability to
the line.<a name="FNanchor_792" id="FNanchor_792"></a><a href="#Footnote_792" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> A further division of some sort may have been placed
in reserve in the rear.<a name="FNanchor_793" id="FNanchor_793"></a><a href="#Footnote_793" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> Most important of all, the auxiliary
knights from Maine and Brittany, under the command of Helias
of La Flèche and Alan Fergant, were stationed on the field at
some distance to one side<a name="FNanchor_794" id="FNanchor_794"></a><a href="#Footnote_794" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> in readiness for a strategic stroke at
the proper moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>The action was opened by William of Mortain, who charged at
the head of Robert’s vanguard;<a name="FNanchor_795" id="FNanchor_795"></a><a href="#Footnote_795" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> and for a time the ducal
forces gained a considerable advantage and pushed the royal van
back at several points. But they were unable to gain a decision;
and while the opposing forces were locked together in a great
mêlée of hand-to-hand encounters, the Bretons and the Manceaux
charged impetuously from their distant position, and, falling
upon the flank of the ducal forces, cut them in two and wrought
great havoc among the foot soldiers.<a name="FNanchor_796" id="FNanchor_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_796" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> Robert of Bellême, seeing
which way the battle was going, saved himself by flight; and the
forces of the duke thereupon dissolved in a general rout.<a name="FNanchor_797" id="FNanchor_797"></a><a href="#Footnote_797" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p>Robert Curthose was captured by Waldric, the king’s chancellor,
who, though a cleric, had taken his place among the knights
in the battle.<a name="FNanchor_798" id="FNanchor_798"></a><a href="#Footnote_798" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> The Bretons captured William of Mortain and
were with some difficulty persuaded to surrender their prize to
the king. Robert d’Estouteville, William de Ferrières, William
Crispin, Edgar Atheling, and many others were also taken prisoners.<a name="FNanchor_799" id="FNanchor_799"></a><a href="#Footnote_799" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>
Henry pardoned some, including the Atheling, and set
them at liberty, but others he kept in confinement for the rest of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
their lives.<a name="FNanchor_800" id="FNanchor_800"></a><a href="#Footnote_800" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> A considerable number of the duke’s foot soldiers
had been slain, and many more had been captured.<a name="FNanchor_801" id="FNanchor_801"></a><a href="#Footnote_801" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> But the
casualties among the king’s forces had been negligible. “Hardly
two” of his men had been killed, while “only one,” Robert de
Bonebos, had been wounded.<a name="FNanchor_802" id="FNanchor_802"></a><a href="#Footnote_802" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> The battle had been joined at
about nine o’clock in the morning, probably on the 29th of
September<a name="FNanchor_803" id="FNanchor_803"></a><a href="#Footnote_803" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> 1106. It had lasted “barely an hour,”<a name="FNanchor_804" id="FNanchor_804"></a><a href="#Footnote_804" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> yet it
deserves to rank among the decisive battles of the twelfth century,
for it had settled the fate of Normandy and of Robert
Curthose.</p>

recorded, except that apparently the duke conceded to Robert of Bellême “the
castle of Argentan, the bishopric of Séez, and the forest of Gouffern.” Inasmuch as
the duke had originally made this grant before the expedition against England
in 1101 (<i>supra</i>, p. 127 and n. 30), it seems evident that at some time during the
struggle with Bellême he had revoked it, and that now, upon making peace, he was
obliged to restore it or confirm it. Ordericus charges repeatedly that in making
this peace without consulting Henry I, the duke acted in direct violation of the
treaty of Alton. Ordericus, iv, pp. 162, 192, 200.</p>

clearly an error, since he was present at the dedication of the church of Saint-Évroul
in October 1099, and since he was at Winchester in August 1100, when

<p><a name="Footnote_683" id="Footnote_683"></a><a href="#FNanchor_683"><span class="label">[44]</span></a> The foregoing details have been drawn from Ordericus (iv, pp. 162-163) and
from Wace (<i>Roman de Rou</i>, ii, pp. 449-454), the only writers who report this episode
with any fulness. They are not in complete accord, yet on the whole they confirm
and support one another to a remarkable degree. Ordericus endeavors to justify
the king at every point. Wace, on the other hand, sees the king’s action in its true
light, but he adds many details which are probably imaginative. Ordericus makes
no mention of the part played by the queen; but Wace makes this a leading feature
of the episode. Can this be mere embroidery on the brief statement of William of
Malmesbury: “Porro ille, quasi cum fortuna certaret utrum plus illa daret an ipse
dispergeret, sola voluntate reginae tacite postulantis comperta, tantam massam
argenti benignus in perpetuum ignovit; acclines foeminei fastus preces pro magno

controversy over Thorold, the appointee of William Rufus to the see of Bayeux
after the death of Bishop Odo. On 8 October, apparently 1104, Pascal II wrote to
the clergy and people of Bayeux announcing the condemnation of Thorold because,
among other things, he had failed to keep his promise to King Henry not to receive
investiture from Duke Robert: “Pro his igitur omnibus pro fide etiam non accipiendi
a Normannorum comite honoris aecclesiastici ante conspectum Anglici regis data
depositionis in eum erat promenda sententia.” “Lettre inédite de Pascal II,” ed.
Germain Morin, in <i>Revue d’histoire ecclésiastique</i>, v (1904), pp. 284-285. But the
execution of the sentence was delayed for a long period, and the Pope satisfied himself
that Thorold had not received investiture from the duke. <i>Epistolae Paschalis</i>,
in Migne, clxiii, col. 188. Thorold was deposed, however, upon other grounds, apparently
in 1107. Ordericus, iv, p. 18; Morin, in <i>Revue d’histoire ecclésiastique</i>, v,
pp. 286-288. For an exhaustive discussion of all that is known and for many conjectures
about Thorold, see Wilhelm Tavernier, “Beiträge zur Rolandsforschung,”
in <i>Zeitschrift für französiche Sprache und Litteratur</i>, xxxvii, pp. 103-124; xxxviii,
pp. 117-135; xxxix, pp. 133-151. Tavernier believes that Thorold was the author
of the <i>Chanson de Roland</i>.</p>

by the Conqueror to Count Baldwin V (William of Malmesbury, <i>G. R.</i>, ii, p. 478)
and extending to the reign of Henry II (<i>Foedera</i>, i, pp. 6, 7, 22; <i>Liber Niger</i>, i,

gives an elaborate account of the conspiracy, which is perhaps worth summarizing.
Thierry, son of Ralph Fitz Ogier, and several other citizens of Caen had been ambushed
and captured by Robert of Saint-Rémy-des-Landes at Cagny in the Hiémois
while travelling home from Argences; Robert of Saint-Rémy had taken his prisoners
to Torigny and sold them for a great price to Robert Fitz Hamon; who, in turn,
surrendered them to the king, in exchange for the grant of Caen as a fief to be held
by himself and his heirs forever. The king was delighted over the acquisition of
these prisoners, “riches homes de Caan nez,” for he saw in them the possibility of
gaining Caen without striking a blow. A convention was quickly agreed upon.
Henry promised to free the prisoners and to enrich them with lands and goods; and
they undertook to deliver Caen into his hands. And to seal the bargain, they gave
hostages, “filz e nevoz de lor lignages.” Great precautions were taken to deceive
“la gent menue”;</p>

<p class="noindent">though many prominent burgesses were involved in the conspiracy, and treason
was spreading far and wide throughout the city before the duke got wind of it.
Then, with the king’s men from the Bessin close at hand, and desertion general
among the citizens, Robert had no choice but to flee by the Porte Milet to the
Hiémois, leaving his baggage behind to be ransacked at the gate.</p>

destruction of the abbey must, therefore, be referred to 1106, since it would have
been impossible for Abbot Robert to have gained possession of the monastery and
to have erected a fortress in it while Henry was still in Normandy in the previous
summer, the king having returned to England in August. This conclusion is confirmed
by the Annals of Winchester: “MCVI. Hoc anno rex in Normanniam duxit

mediaeval figures are not to be relied upon. Cf. <i>E. H. R.</i>, xviii, pp. 625-629. The
estimate of the priest of Fécamp (<i>E. H. R.</i>, xxv, p. 296), placing the king’s forces
at 40,000 and the duke’s at 6000, of which 700 were knights, is doubtless an exaggeration.
It is good evidence, however, of the king’s numerical superiority, which
is also indicated by Henry of Huntingdon (p. 235). Ordericus Vitalis grants that
the duke was inferior to the king in knights, but asserts that he had more foot
soldiers.</p>

It is based upon the authority of the <i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i> (<i>a.</i> 1106), which is
copied by Florence of Worcester (ii, p. 55), and upon the <i>Chronicon Breve Fontanellense</i>
(<i>H. F.</i>, xii, p. 771). But, in view of the explicit statement of the priest
of Fécamp, 29 September is probably the correct date. William of Malmesbury
(<i>G. R.</i>, ii, p. 475) confusingly dates the battle “sabbato in Sancti Michaelis vigilia.”
Michaelmas in 1106 fell upon Saturday. A further variation is introduced by
Robert of Torigny, who dates the battle 27 September. <i>Interpolations de Robert

<p>Soon after the battle of Tinchebray Henry I wrote exultingly to
Anselm, announcing the great victory and boasting that he had
captured four hundred knights and ten thousand foot soldiers,
and that the number of slain was legion.<a name="FNanchor_805" id="FNanchor_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_805" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> It was a pardonable
exaggeration, for indeed the battle had ended all resistance and
decided the fate of Normandy. The duke seems to have had no
thought of a continuance of the struggle, and meekly submitted
to his conqueror. Henry hastened to the great stronghold of
Falaise, which had successfully defied him the year before, and at
the duke’s own command it was promptly surrendered into his
hands.<a name="FNanchor_806" id="FNanchor_806"></a><a href="#Footnote_806" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Then he pressed on with his captive to Rouen, where he
received a cordial welcome from the burgesses, to whom he restored
the laws of the Conqueror and all the honors which their
city had previously enjoyed.<a name="FNanchor_807" id="FNanchor_807"></a><a href="#Footnote_807" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> And, again at the duke’s command,
Hugh de Nonant handed over the citadel to the king. The
duke, too, formally absolved the fortified towns (<i>municipia</i>)
throughout all Normandy from their allegiance, and their defenders
hastened to make peace with the victor.<a name="FNanchor_808" id="FNanchor_808"></a><a href="#Footnote_808" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Even the king’s
most bitter enemies sought a reconciliation. Ranulf Flambard,
the exiled bishop of Durham, who had caused such a scandal in the
see of Lisieux, and who was still residing there as lord of the city
(<i>princeps in urbe</i>), humbly sent to seek peace, and, upon surrendering
Lisieux, was restored to his bishopric of Durham.<a name="FNanchor_809" id="FNanchor_809"></a><a href="#Footnote_809" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The terrible
Robert of Bellême still boasted the possession of thirty-four
strong castles, and for a moment he seems to have contemplated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
further resistance. But an appeal for aid to Helias of La Flèche
met with no encouragement; and at the advice and through the
mediation of the latter, he chose the prudent course of making
peace with Henry upon the best terms possible. By the surrender
of all the ducal domain which he had occupied illegally, he
managed to obtain Argentan and the <i>vicomté</i> of Falaise, together
with certain other possessions which had formerly been held by his
father, Roger of Montgomery.<a name="FNanchor_810" id="FNanchor_810"></a><a href="#Footnote_810" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> But these temporary concessions
to Robert of Bellême were almost the only ones which the king
felt it necessary to make. For, while he favored the clergy and
gave peace and protection to the humble and unarmed population,
he made it his first business to curb the restless baronage. He
ordered the destruction of adulterine castles throughout the
duchy.<a name="FNanchor_811" id="FNanchor_811"></a><a href="#Footnote_811" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Summoning a council of magnates at Lisieux in the
middle of October, he proclaimed a royal peace, asserted his title
to all the ducal domain which Robert Curthose through extravagance
or weakness had let slip from his hands, and guaranteed to
the churches and other legitimate holders all the possessions which
they had lawfully enjoyed at the time of the Conqueror’s death.<a name="FNanchor_812" id="FNanchor_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_812" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
Such measures brought despair to outlaws and evil men, but they
inaugurated a new era of vigorous and orderly government which
was welcomed with the utmost gratitude by all peace-loving subjects,
especially by the clergy.<a name="FNanchor_813" id="FNanchor_813"></a><a href="#Footnote_813" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Anselm wrote to the king, saluting
him as ‘duke,’ to congratulate him upon his splendid victory,
and to thank him for the promise of good and considerate government.<a name="FNanchor_814" id="FNanchor_814"></a><a href="#Footnote_814" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>Henry remained in Normandy during the autumn and winter
to complete the organization of the new régime. In January
1107 he called the nobles together at Falaise, and in March he
held another council at Lisieux, and promulgated many important
decrees for the administration of the duchy.<a name="FNanchor_815" id="FNanchor_815"></a><a href="#Footnote_815" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> And then, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
Lent, “when he had either destroyed his enemies or subdued
them, and had disposed of Normandy according to his will,”<a name="FNanchor_816" id="FNanchor_816"></a><a href="#Footnote_816" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> he
returned to England, and held his Easter court at Windsor.<a name="FNanchor_817" id="FNanchor_817"></a><a href="#Footnote_817" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
And there “both Norman and English barons were present with
fear and trembling.”<a name="FNanchor_818" id="FNanchor_818"></a><a href="#Footnote_818" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>Apparently the king had sent his prisoners, including the duke,
on before him to England, lest the turbulent Normans, under the
guise of aiding Robert Curthose, should break the peace.<a name="FNanchor_819" id="FNanchor_819"></a><a href="#Footnote_819" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> And
once he had them safely across the Channel he took good care
that they should never escape him. William of Mortain, at least,
was placed in close confinement for the rest of his life; and, if
Henry of Huntingdon can be trusted, he was blinded.<a name="FNanchor_820" id="FNanchor_820"></a><a href="#Footnote_820" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Robert
Curthose, it seems, was kept in free custody and provided with
certain comforts and even luxuries;<a name="FNanchor_821" id="FNanchor_821"></a><a href="#Footnote_821" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> but his confinement was not
made less secure for that. According to the Annals of Winchester,
he was first imprisoned at Wareham;<a name="FNanchor_822" id="FNanchor_822"></a><a href="#Footnote_822" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> but he was afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
given into the custody of the great Bishop Roger of Salisbury,
who kept him in his magnificent castle at Devizes.<a name="FNanchor_823" id="FNanchor_823"></a><a href="#Footnote_823" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>In 1107 King Henry’s triumph seemed complete. He was now
master both in England and in Normandy as he had never been
before.<a name="FNanchor_824" id="FNanchor_824"></a><a href="#Footnote_824" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> His conquest of the duchy had been willingly accepted
by both clergy and people. And even Louis, the king designate of
France—contrary, it may be observed, to his father Philip’s
advice—had officially ratified his action.<a name="FNanchor_825" id="FNanchor_825"></a><a href="#Footnote_825" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Yet Henry’s troubles
in Normandy had hardly begun, and the following years were a
period of almost incessant warfare for the maintenance of his
conquest. Hostility between him and his continental neighbors
was, indeed, inevitable. With the accession Louis VI (le Gros) to
the throne of France in 1108, the Capetians entered upon an era
of royal ascendancy which necessarily made them look with
jealous eyes upon their great feudatories, particularly the dukes
of Normandy. The union of England and Normandy brought an
increase of strength and of ambition to Henry I which rendered
him dangerous not only to his overlord, the king of France, but
also to his neighbors on the north and south in Flanders and
Anjou; while in Normandy itself, the turbulent baronage soon
grew restive under the stern rule of the ‘Lion of Justice,’ and were
ever ready to ally themselves with anyone who would make common
cause with them against him. And, unfortunately for Henry,
he had made one fatal mistake in his settlement of Normandy
after Tinchebray, which left a standing temptation in the way of
the disaffected Norman baronage and of his jealous neighbors
beyond the frontier.</p>

<p>The son of Robert Curthose, William surnamed the Clito, had
fallen into the king’s hands at the surrender of Falaise in 1106,<a name="FNanchor_826" id="FNanchor_826"></a><a href="#Footnote_826" class="fnanchor">[22]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
and it would have been possible for Henry to have made away
with him or to have placed him in permanent confinement, just
as he had imprisoned the duke. But William Clito was still a
child of tender years, and Henry feared public sentiment. Rather
than bear the responsibility if any evil should befall the lad while
in his hands, he placed him in ward with Helias of Saint-Saëns,
Duke Robert’s son-in-law, to be brought up and educated.<a name="FNanchor_827" id="FNanchor_827"></a><a href="#Footnote_827" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
Henry soon repented of this indiscretion, however, and, at the
advice of certain of his counsellors, he gave orders for the Clito to
be taken into custody. But before Robert de Beauchamp, the
<i>vicomte</i> of Arques, who was charged with the execution of the
king’s command, could carry out his mission, friends of the child
learned of the impending stroke, and carried him away sleeping
from his bed and hid him; and soon after the stanch Helias of
Saint-Saëns fled with him into exile.<a name="FNanchor_828" id="FNanchor_828"></a><a href="#Footnote_828" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Abandoning all that they
had in Normandy,<a name="FNanchor_829" id="FNanchor_829"></a><a href="#Footnote_829" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Helias and the Clito’s tutor, Tirel de Mainières,
devoted their lives to their charge,<a name="FNanchor_830" id="FNanchor_830"></a><a href="#Footnote_830" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> finding a refuge now
here, now there, among King Henry’s enemies in France and
Flanders and Anjou.<a name="FNanchor_831" id="FNanchor_831"></a><a href="#Footnote_831" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>It would lead us too far afield to trace in detail the tragic career
of William Clito. But its salient features may, at least, be indicated;
for he was the last hope of the lost cause of Robert
Curthose.</p>

<p>The Clito rapidly grew to be a youth of uncommon attractions—“mult
fu amez de chevaliers”<a name="FNanchor_832" id="FNanchor_832"></a><a href="#Footnote_832" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>—and his pathetic story
made an irresistible appeal to the discontented and ambitious,
both in Normandy and beyond the frontiers.<a name="FNanchor_833" id="FNanchor_833"></a><a href="#Footnote_833" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Robert of Bellême,
until he was captured in 1112 and sent to end his days in an
English prison,<a name="FNanchor_834" id="FNanchor_834"></a><a href="#Footnote_834" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> made himself in a special way the patron and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
supporter of the Clito;<a name="FNanchor_835" id="FNanchor_835"></a><a href="#Footnote_835" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> and the cause of the injured exile, mere
child that he was, undoubtedly lay back of much of the desultory
warfare in which King Henry was involved in Normandy and on
the French frontier between 1109 and 1113. Count Robert of
Flanders lost his life fighting in Normandy in 1111,<a name="FNanchor_836" id="FNanchor_836"></a><a href="#Footnote_836" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> and his successor,
Baldwin VII, gave an asylum to the Clito and conferred on
him the arms of knighthood in his fourteenth year.<a name="FNanchor_837" id="FNanchor_837"></a><a href="#Footnote_837" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>It was between the years 1117 and 1120, however, that the
opponents of King Henry’s continental ambitions first organized
themselves in support of William Clito upon a formidable scale.
Louis VI had repented of his earlier friendship for Henry I,<a name="FNanchor_838" id="FNanchor_838"></a><a href="#Footnote_838" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> and
in 1117 he entered into a sworn alliance with Baldwin of Flanders
and Fulk of Anjou to overthrow the English rule in Normandy
and place the Clito on the ducal throne.<a name="FNanchor_839" id="FNanchor_839"></a><a href="#Footnote_839" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Simultaneously, a
widespread revolt broke out among the Norman baronage, and
for three years Henry was involved in a formidable war, which he
conducted with characteristic vigor and success.<a name="FNanchor_840" id="FNanchor_840"></a><a href="#Footnote_840" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> The death of
Count Baldwin eliminated Flanders from the contest.<a name="FNanchor_841" id="FNanchor_841"></a><a href="#Footnote_841" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> Henry
succeeded in making peace and forming an alliance with Fulk of
Anjou in June 1119.<a name="FNanchor_842" id="FNanchor_842"></a><a href="#Footnote_842" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> And in the decisive battle of Brémule in
the same year, the English overwhelmed the French, and Louis VI
fled from the field.<a name="FNanchor_843" id="FNanchor_843"></a><a href="#Footnote_843" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> But from arms the French king turned to
diplomacy. He appeared with the Clito before the council of
Rheims (October 1119), and laid the cause of Robert Curthose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
and of his exiled son before the assembled prelates with such telling
effect<a name="FNanchor_844" id="FNanchor_844"></a><a href="#Footnote_844" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> that Pope Calixtus set out for Normandy to deal in
person with the English king. But Henry showed himself as apt
at diplomacy as he had been successful in arms. Meeting the
Pope at Gisors (November 1119), he welcomed him with the utmost
courtesy and with an extraordinary show of humility.<a name="FNanchor_845" id="FNanchor_845"></a><a href="#Footnote_845" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
He provided elaborately for his entertainment.<a name="FNanchor_846" id="FNanchor_846"></a><a href="#Footnote_846" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> And when
Calixtus arraigned him for his unjust conduct, and, in the name of
the council, called upon him to release Robert Curthose from
prison and to restore him and the Clito to the duchy,<a name="FNanchor_847" id="FNanchor_847"></a><a href="#Footnote_847" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Henry
replied in an elaborate speech, placing the whole responsibility
upon the duke. He declared that he had been obliged to conquer
Normandy in order to rescue it from anarchy, and that he had
offered to confer three English counties upon the Clito and to
bring him up in all honor at his court.<a name="FNanchor_848" id="FNanchor_848"></a><a href="#Footnote_848" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Strange to say, the Pope
professed himself entirely convinced by Henry’s assertions and
declared that “nothing could be more just than the king of England’s
cause.” But William of Malmesbury explains that the
royal arguments were “well seasoned with rich gifts.”<a name="FNanchor_849" id="FNanchor_849"></a><a href="#Footnote_849" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Henry
had won the Pope, and through the latter’s mediation a peace was
soon arranged with Louis VI upon the basis of mutual restitutions;
and William Atheling, Henry’s son, did homage to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
king of France for Normandy (1120).<a name="FNanchor_850" id="FNanchor_850"></a><a href="#Footnote_850" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> The Norman rebels, too,
seeing that their cause was hopeless, hastily made peace with
Henry, and at his command did homage and swore fealty to the
Atheling.<a name="FNanchor_851" id="FNanchor_851"></a><a href="#Footnote_851" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> William Clito was deserted on almost every hand, and
his cause did indeed seem hopeless. If we can trust the chronicle
of Hyde monastery, he sent messengers to King Henry and
humbly besought him to release his father from captivity, and
promised, if his request were granted, to depart with him for
Jerusalem, abandoning Normandy to the king and his heirs forever,
and never again to appear this side the Julian Alps.<a name="FNanchor_852" id="FNanchor_852"></a><a href="#Footnote_852" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>King Henry, we are told, treated these overtures with arrogant
contempt, as well he might in view of his victory over all his
enemies. Yet before the end of the year the loss of the Atheling
on the <i>White Ship</i> put all his well laid plans awry, and left William
Clito, his bitter enemy, as the most direct heir of all his dominions
both in Normandy and England.<a name="FNanchor_853" id="FNanchor_853"></a><a href="#Footnote_853" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> Soon his old enemies began
to rally to the Clito’s cause; and he was again confronted with a
formidable revolt of the Norman baronage (1123-25), which had
at least the tacit support of the king of France.<a name="FNanchor_854" id="FNanchor_854"></a><a href="#Footnote_854" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> Fulk of Anjou,
in league with the rebels, abandoned the English alliance and conferred
the county of Maine, together with the hand of his younger
daughter Sibyl, upon the Clito.<a name="FNanchor_855" id="FNanchor_855"></a><a href="#Footnote_855" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> Though Henry succeeded in
having this marriage annulled by papal decree in 1124 upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
ground of consanguinity,<a name="FNanchor_856" id="FNanchor_856"></a><a href="#Footnote_856" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> Louis VI continued to support the
Clito. At his Christmas court in 1126 he called upon the assembled
barons to assist the young prince.<a name="FNanchor_857" id="FNanchor_857"></a><a href="#Footnote_857" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> Shortly thereafter
he gave him the half-sister of his own queen in marriage and conferred
upon him Pontoise, Chaumont, Mantes, and the whole of
the Vexin. Before Lent 1127 the Clito appeared at Gisors at the
head of an armed force, and laid claim to Normandy.<a name="FNanchor_858" id="FNanchor_858"></a><a href="#Footnote_858" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> And soon
afterwards the foul murder of Count Charles the Good opened
the question of the Flemish succession, and gave the king of
France, as overlord of the county, an opportunity to raise his
protégé to the throne of Flanders, although the king of England
was himself a candidate for the honor.<a name="FNanchor_859" id="FNanchor_859"></a><a href="#Footnote_859" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> The fortunes of the
Clito were now decidedly in the ascendant, and it behooved
Henry I to bestir himself to check his progress. He crossed the
Channel and began active military operations against the Franco-Flemish
alliance.<a name="FNanchor_860" id="FNanchor_860"></a><a href="#Footnote_860" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> He sent his agents into Flanders to distribute
bribes and build up a combination against the new count. He
freely subsidized the rival claimants to the county.<a name="FNanchor_861" id="FNanchor_861"></a><a href="#Footnote_861" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> But
Henry’s problem was soon solved for him by a civil war in which,
so far as we know, he had no part or influence. William Clito had
allied himself with the feudal aristocracy of Flanders, but he had
failed to comprehend the spirit of the progressive bourgeoisie, to
whom his predecessor, Charles the Good, had made important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
concessions.<a name="FNanchor_862" id="FNanchor_862"></a><a href="#Footnote_862" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> Increasing friction with the burgesses soon led to
an insurrection, and the Clito was wounded at the siege of Alost,
late in July 1128, and died soon after.<a name="FNanchor_863" id="FNanchor_863"></a><a href="#Footnote_863" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> That night, Robert
Curthose, we are told, lying in his distant English prison, dreamed
that he had himself been wounded in the right arm; and waking,
“Alas!” he said, with telepathic vision, “my son is dead.”<a name="FNanchor_864" id="FNanchor_864"></a><a href="#Footnote_864" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> It
was, indeed, the end of all hope for the captive duke; and thereafter
Henry I ruled in peace in Normandy as well as England.</p>

<p>Of the vicissitudes of Robert Curthose during the long years of
his imprisonment we know almost nothing. A curious notice in
the chronicle of Monte Cassino for the year 1117 styles him
‘king of the English,’ and avers that his ‘legates’ had visited the
monastery, and, presenting the monks with a precious golden
chalice, had besought their prayers for himself and his realm.<a name="FNanchor_865" id="FNanchor_865"></a><a href="#Footnote_865" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
In 1126, upon his return from Normandy, Henry I transferred the
duke from the custody of Bishop Roger of Salisbury to that of
Earl Robert of Gloucester, who placed him in confinement at
first in his great stronghold at Bristol.<a name="FNanchor_866" id="FNanchor_866"></a><a href="#Footnote_866" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> But later he moved him
to Cardiff castle in his Welsh lordship of Glamorgan;<a name="FNanchor_867" id="FNanchor_867"></a><a href="#Footnote_867" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> and
there, in this wild frontier stronghold, in full view of the ‘Severn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
Sea’ Robert Curthose ended his days. If we can rely upon our
evidence, he took advantage of his long imprisonment to master
the Welsh language, and amused himself with verse-making.
And he appears to have left behind him a poem of no mean order.
It was extracted by the Welsh bard, Edward Williams,<a name="FNanchor_868" id="FNanchor_868"></a><a href="#Footnote_868" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> “from
a MS. of Mr. Thomas Truman, of Pant Lliwydd (Dyer’s valley),
near Cowbridge, Glamorgan, containing, in the Welsh language,
‘An Account of the Lords Marchers of Glamorgan from Robert
Fitz Hamon down to Jasper, Duke of Bedford,’ and written about
the year 1500,”<a name="FNanchor_869" id="FNanchor_869"></a><a href="#Footnote_869" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> and was published in the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i>
in 1794, from which it seems worth while to quote it in full, together
with the attribution of authorship:</p>

they are in their tragic pathos no inapt epitome of his misdirected
career, which had begun with such bright promise and ended in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
such signal disaster. ‘Woe to him that is in the power of his
enemies,’ ‘woe to him that is not old enough to die’—often
must these sentiments have haunted him during the long years of
his captivity. But his melancholy longings at last found satisfaction.
Early in February 1134 he died at Cardiff,<a name="FNanchor_872" id="FNanchor_872"></a><a href="#Footnote_872" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> a venerable

constitute the only evidence that Robert became acquainted with the Welsh
language and wrote verses. The poem has been several times printed, but all texts
of it derive from a single source, viz., Williams’s transcript of the Pantlliwyd manuscript.
According to Mr. John Ballinger, librarian of the National Library of
Wales, to whom I am indebted for the foregoing information, Williams’s statements
as to the sources from which he made his copies are usually accurate, but his deductions
are often uncritical and faulty.</p>

known effigy of Robert Curthose in wood with which his tomb was later adorned
is still preserved in Gloucester cathedral—the abbey church having become the
cathedral upon the institution of the bishopric in 1541. It is no longer in its original
position, but is in the northeast chapel, called Abbot Boteler’s chapel, off the ambulatory.
It was broken into several pieces during the civil wars of Charles I, but
was repaired and restored to the cathedral through the generosity of Sir Humphrey
Tracey of Stanway. It was evidently still in its original position when Leland saw
it in the sixteenth century. He says: “Robᵗᵘˢ. Curthoise, sonne to K. William
the Conquerour, lyeth in the midle of the Presbitery. There is on his Tombe an
Image of Wood paynted, made longe since his Death.” <i>The Itinerary of John Leland
the Antiquary</i>, ed. Thomas Hearne, 3d ed. (Oxford, 1769), iv, p. 80. According
to W. V. Guise the effigy is of “a date not very remote from the period at which
the duke lived.” He bases his opinion upon the fact that the hauberk of chain-mail
and the long surcote, as represented in the effigy, ceased to be worn after the
thirteenth century. <i>Records of Gloucester Cathedral</i>, ed. William Bazeley (Gloucester,
n. d.), i, 1, p. 101. Nothing appears to be known as to who provided for
the effigy or as to the circumstances under which it was wrought. See H. J. L.

<span class="smaller">ROBERT CURTHOSE IN LEGEND<a name="FNanchor_875" id="FNanchor_875"></a><a href="#Footnote_875" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></span></h2>

<p>Though Robert’s life had been filled with failures and had ended
in a signal disaster, his memory by no means perished with him.
As a leader in the Holy War he had earned an enviable fame,
which was early enhanced by legend; and if modern writers have
been guilty of some exaggeration in their estimates of his merit as
a crusader,<a name="FNanchor_876" id="FNanchor_876"></a><a href="#Footnote_876" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> they have merely perpetuated unconsciously a tradition
which was already well established in the literature of the
later Middle Ages. William of Malmesbury, writing as early as
1125, declared that Robert gave proof of his valor on the Crusade
by many wonderful feats of arms, for “neither Christian nor
pagan could ever unhorse him,” and he goes on to add details
about his exploits at Antioch and the honor of the kingship which
was offered him at Jerusalem.<a name="FNanchor_877" id="FNanchor_877"></a><a href="#Footnote_877" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The more extended account of
Wace is equally flattering:</p>

<p>The foregoing illustrations, written during the duke’s lifetime
or within a generation after his death, offer a convincing demonstration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
of the extraordinary rapidity with which legend set to
work to rehabilitate the memory of the vanquished of Tinchebray;
and it will not be without interest to make at least a cursory
examination of these unhistorical traditions, in so far as they
reflect the duke’s reputation among the writers of the later Middle
Ages. Gaston Paris has not hesitated to affirm that Robert, as a
crusader, became the hero of a whole poetic cycle which has since
been lost, though not without leaving traces in the literature of
after times.<a name="FNanchor_880" id="FNanchor_880"></a><a href="#Footnote_880" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Stated in this sweeping form, the pronouncement
of this distinguished scholar is perhaps an unwarrantable exaggeration;
at any rate, in the present state of the evidence it can
hardly be regarded as more than a bold hypothesis.<a name="FNanchor_881" id="FNanchor_881"></a><a href="#Footnote_881" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> But if there
was not, properly speaking, a Norman cycle of the Crusade of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
which Robert was the hero, there certainly were numerous legends
which it seems worth while to bring together in such order
as is possible in the arrangement of matter so scattered and
fragmentary.</p>

<p>William of Malmesbury has sounded the keynote of Robert’s
later fame as a crusader:<a name="FNanchor_882" id="FNanchor_882"></a><a href="#Footnote_882" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> it was his personal prowess on the
field of battle which most impressed itself upon the imagination
of later generations. With one exception of minor importance,<a name="FNanchor_883" id="FNanchor_883"></a><a href="#Footnote_883" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
later writers tell us little or nothing of a legendary character respecting
the position and achievements of Robert at the siege of
Nicaea; but his imaginary exploits in the battle of Dorylaeum
(1 July 1097) begin to meet us in accounts which are almost
contemporary. Robert the Monk, writing before 1107, pictures
him as the saviour of the day. The Franks were all but overwhelmed
and had turned in flight, and the contest would surely
have ended in disaster for them, had not the count of Normandy
quickly turned his charger and checked the rout by waving aloft
his golden banner and calling out the inspiring battle cry, <i>Deus
vult! Deus vult!</i><a name="FNanchor_884" id="FNanchor_884"></a><a href="#Footnote_884" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> In the <i>Gesta Tancredi</i> of Ralph of Caen, written
but a few years later, Robert appears as a hero whose valor
surpassed even that of the great Bohemond; for in the crisis of
the battle, remembering who he was and the royal blood which
flowed in his veins, he turned upon his fleeing comrades and
shouted: “O Bohemond! why do you fly? Apulia and Otranto
and the confines of the Latin world are far away. Let us stand
fast. Either the victor’s crown or a glorious death awaits us:
glory will there be in either fate, but it will be the greater glory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
which makes us sooner martyrs. Therefore, strike, O youths, and
let us fall upon them and die if need be!”<a name="FNanchor_885" id="FNanchor_885"></a><a href="#Footnote_885" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> And with that the
flight was halted. Henry of Huntingdon puts a similar speech
into the mouth of Robert, and gives an even more wonderful
account of his exploits in the battle. In Henry’s story, when
Robert had finished speaking, he charged upon a paynim king
and with one mighty thrust of his lance pierced his shield, armor,
and body; then he felled a second and a third of the infidels.<a name="FNanchor_886" id="FNanchor_886"></a><a href="#Footnote_886" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
And from Henry of Huntingdon the account of Robert’s prowess
on the field of Dorylaeum was handed on with slight modification
from writer to writer throughout the mediaeval period.<a name="FNanchor_887" id="FNanchor_887"></a><a href="#Footnote_887" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>The further legendary exploits of Robert Curthose are in the
main connected with the great battles at Antioch by which the
Christians drove off the successive relief forces which the Moslems
sent against them, first the army of Ridwan of Aleppo (9 February
1098) and then the host of Kerboga of Mosul (28 June 1098).
Actually Robert seems to have taken no part in the earlier battle;<a name="FNanchor_888" id="FNanchor_888"></a><a href="#Footnote_888" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
but in the account of the admiring Henry of Huntingdon, we
find him leading the first division in the action, and, with a single
blow of his mighty sword, splitting head, teeth, neck, and even the
shoulders (<i>usque in pectora</i>) of a pagan warrior.<a name="FNanchor_889" id="FNanchor_889"></a><a href="#Footnote_889" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> And while this
feat of arms, like the exploits at Dorylaeum, appears to be unknown
to the poems of the Godfrey cycle, it was taken up and
passed on by English and Norman writers to the close of the Middle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
Ages.<a name="FNanchor_890" id="FNanchor_890"></a><a href="#Footnote_890" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Indeed, new and grotesque exaggerations were added
to it. Presently we learn that Robert not only split the paynim’s
head and a portion of his body, but his shield and his helmet also;
that he slew him even as one slaughters a sheep; and that as the
body fell to earth the victor cried aloud commending its blood-stained
soul to all the minions of Tartarus!<a name="FNanchor_891" id="FNanchor_891"></a><a href="#Footnote_891" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> One would have
thought this sufficient, surely, but another version tells us that
Godfrey came to Robert’s assistance, and with a second blow cleft
the unfortunate pagan in twain, so that one half of his body fell to
the ground while his charger bore the other in among the infidels!<a name="FNanchor_892" id="FNanchor_892"></a><a href="#Footnote_892" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>It was however in the later battle with Kerboga that, according
to the legends, Robert performed his greatest feat of arms. The
trustworthy accounts tells us merely that he led the third division
in action.<a name="FNanchor_893" id="FNanchor_893"></a><a href="#Footnote_893" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> But William of Malmesbury has represented him as
attacking the great Kerboga himself, while the latter was rallying
the Moslem forces, and slaying him.<a name="FNanchor_894" id="FNanchor_894"></a><a href="#Footnote_894" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> And this tradition was preserved
in England and in Normandy without elaboration throughout
the twelfth century.<a name="FNanchor_895" id="FNanchor_895"></a><a href="#Footnote_895" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Wace seems to mention the incident,
but without any indication that Kerboga was killed by Robert;<a name="FNanchor_896" id="FNanchor_896"></a><a href="#Footnote_896" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
and in this he is in agreement with the earliest extant version of
the Godfrey cycle, the so-called <i>Chanson d’Antioche</i>, which narrates
the exploit in truly epic form:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">The count of Normandy was of right haughty mien;</div>
<div class="verse">Full armed he sat upon his steed of dappled gray.</div>
<div class="verse">He dashed into the mêlée like a leopard;</div>
<div class="verse">And his doughty vassals followed him;</div>
<div class="verse">There was wrought great slaughter of accursed Saracens.</div>
<div class="verse">Kerboga was seated before his standard;</div>
<div class="verse">Richly was he armed, he feared neither lance nor dart;</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
<div class="verse">From his neck a rich buckler was suspended;</div>
<div class="verse">His helmet was forged in the city of ‘Baudart’;</div>
<div class="verse">A carbuncle burned upon the nasal;</div>
<div class="verse">A strong, stiff lance he bore, and a scimitar;</div>
<div class="verse">Upon the shield which swung from his neck a parrot was painted.<a name="FNanchor_897" id="FNanchor_897"></a><a href="#Footnote_897" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></div>
<div class="verse">Kerboga advanced with serried ranks.</div>
<div class="verse">When the count saw him he too advanced upon him,</div>
<div class="verse">And smote him such a blow upon his buckler</div>
<div class="verse">That he threw him, legs in air, into the press.<a name="FNanchor_898" id="FNanchor_898"></a><a href="#Footnote_898" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></div>
<div class="verse">Now he would have cut off his head, but he was too late;</div>
<div class="verse">For Persians and ‘Acopars’ came to the rescue,</div>
<div class="verse">And bore their lord away to his standard.<a name="FNanchor_899" id="FNanchor_899"></a><a href="#Footnote_899" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The <i>Chanson d’ Antioche</i> also narrates another spectacular exploit
in which Robert overthrew and slew the great emir ‘Red Lion’
during the same battle;<a name="FNanchor_900" id="FNanchor_900"></a><a href="#Footnote_900" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> but this episode seems not to have been
repeated in other compilations, and it occupies a far less important
place in the <i>Chanson d’ Antioche</i> than has been supposed by
modern writers, who have sought to trace a connection between it
and the Robert medallion in Suger’s famous stained glass window
at Saint-Denis.<a name="FNanchor_901" id="FNanchor_901"></a><a href="#Footnote_901" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> The later compilation of the Godfrey matter,
edited by Reiffenberg, contains no mention of Robert’s combat
either with Kerboga or with Red Lion; but it relates a very
similar exploit in which he overcame a ‘Saracen king of Tabarie.’
With his lance at the thrust, and raising the triumphant war cry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
“Normandy!”, he bore down upon the Saracen with such force
that he pierced his shield a full palm’s breadth and a half, and
wounded him deeply “between lungs and liver.”<a name="FNanchor_902" id="FNanchor_902"></a><a href="#Footnote_902" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Finally,
mention must be made of Robert’s prowess in the legendary battle
on the plain of Ramleh before Jerusalem, as told in the fantastic
account of the <i>Chanson de Jérusalem</i>. This time it was a
Turkish King Atenas whom he slew, and many others besides, so
that the ground was strewn with the enemy dead. But at last he
was surrounded and all but overborne by numbers. His horse
was struck down under him, and it was only after desperate
fighting against almost hopeless odds that he was finally rescued,
when bleeding from many wounds, by his fellow princes.<a name="FNanchor_903" id="FNanchor_903"></a><a href="#Footnote_903" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>Thus the Robert Curthose of the legends enjoyed a marvellous
repute for warlike prowess; and when Jerusalem had at last been
won, his valor was rewarded, we are told, with an offer of the
crown of the Latin Kingdom, which he promptly rejected.<a name="FNanchor_904" id="FNanchor_904"></a><a href="#Footnote_904" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Resting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
upon no valid contemporary authority,<a name="FNanchor_905" id="FNanchor_905"></a><a href="#Footnote_905" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> this tradition arose
very early, and lent itself to strange distortions as it passed from
author to author. It appears first in William of Malmesbury,<a name="FNanchor_906" id="FNanchor_906"></a><a href="#Footnote_906" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
but it is also to be found before the middle of the twelfth century
in Henry of Huntington<a name="FNanchor_907" id="FNanchor_907"></a><a href="#Footnote_907" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> and in the <i>Historia Belli Sacri</i>.<a name="FNanchor_908" id="FNanchor_908"></a><a href="#Footnote_908" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> In its
simplest form it long continued to be repeated by both English
and Norman writers.<a name="FNanchor_909" id="FNanchor_909"></a><a href="#Footnote_909" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> But it also developed strange variations.
As has elsewhere been explained, the position of ruler at Jerusalem
was actually offered to Count Raymond of Toulouse and declined
by him before the election of Godfrey.<a name="FNanchor_910" id="FNanchor_910"></a><a href="#Footnote_910" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Perhaps we have
here the historical basis of the tradition that the crown was offered
to Robert. It seems possible to trace the growth of the
legend. By Albert of Aix it is said that when the honor had been
declined by Raymond it was offered in turn to each of the other
chiefs, and that the humble Godfrey was prevailed upon to accept
it only when all the others had refused.<a name="FNanchor_911" id="FNanchor_911"></a><a href="#Footnote_911" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> In the <i>Chanson de
Jérusalem</i> the matter has gone much further. According to this
version, Godfrey was first elected by general acclamation of the
people, but modestly declined the honor and responsibility. Then
the crown was offered to the count of Flanders, to Robert Curthose,
to Bohemond, and so in turn to the other leaders, until all
had declined; whereupon it was decided to seek divine guidance
through the ancient miracle of the holy fire which was accustomed
to descend at Jerusalem each year at Easter tide. Accordingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
the barons assembled in the church of the Holy Sepulchre, each
with an unlighted taper. In the darkness of the night a single
candle burned within the great basilica. At midnight a fierce
storm arose with lightning, wind, and thunder. The sole light was
extinguished. The whole edifice was plunged in darkness. The
barons were filled with fear. Suddenly there was another flash
from heaven, and it was observed that Godfrey’s taper was burning
brightly. The divine will had expressed itself, and the good
duke of Bouillon bowed before it.<a name="FNanchor_912" id="FNanchor_912"></a><a href="#Footnote_912" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> Clearly it was in Godfrey’s
honor that this legend of a miraculous designation first arose.
Yet in the late twelfth or early thirteenth century it was said by
Ralph Niger that it was Robert’s candle which was lighted by the
miraculous flame.<a name="FNanchor_913" id="FNanchor_913"></a><a href="#Footnote_913" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> And once so told, the legend in this form was
handed on from writer to writer to the close of the Middle Ages.<a name="FNanchor_914" id="FNanchor_914"></a><a href="#Footnote_914" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
Langtoft, indeed, declares that Robert was thrice designated by
the holy fire.<a name="FNanchor_915" id="FNanchor_915"></a><a href="#Footnote_915" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>The miracle as told in Robert’s favor, however, involved a
logical difficulty which met with a characteristically mediaeval
solution. According to early tradition Robert had refused to
accept the crown of Jerusalem. The explanation offered by the
<i>Historia Belli Sacri</i> is natural and reasonable. Said Robert:
“Although I have come hither in God’s service, yet have I not
abandoned my county altogether, in order to remain here. And
now that I have fulfilled my vow, if God permits, I desire to return
to my own dominions.”<a name="FNanchor_916" id="FNanchor_916"></a><a href="#Footnote_916" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> But if Robert had been chosen for
the kingship of Jerusalem by divine will and favor, as was almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
universally believed, how was it possible that he should reject
such a token of heavenly grace without committing a sin and incurring
divine displeasure? Did not the disasters which so
quickly overtook him make it abundantly clear that the divine
favor had departed from him? This, indeed, was the mediaeval
explanation. In refusing the Latin crown, Robert had contemned
and spurned the gift of God. Hence his defeat at Tinchebray and
wellnigh thirty years of incarceration. No feature of the Robert
legends was more persistent or more universally accepted than
this. Appearing first in Henry of Huntingdon, it is repeated
again and again to the close of the mediaeval period.<a name="FNanchor_917" id="FNanchor_917"></a><a href="#Footnote_917" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>It remains to notice the legends of pathetic interest which concern
themselves not with Robert’s prowess as a crusader but with
the tragedy of his long imprisonment. It seems clear that Henry
I began by keeping his fallen brother in free custody and treating
him with remarkable liberality.<a name="FNanchor_918" id="FNanchor_918"></a><a href="#Footnote_918" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Indeed, one tradition has preserved
a not unattractive picture of the easy conditions under
which Robert was allowed to live, his food and clothing and daily
exercise and amusements all bounteously and richly provided for
him.<a name="FNanchor_919" id="FNanchor_919"></a><a href="#Footnote_919" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Yet, strange to say, the official historian of the reign of
Henry II makes the statement—if indeed it is to be found no
earlier than this—that the king had his brother blinded;<a name="FNanchor_920" id="FNanchor_920"></a><a href="#Footnote_920" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
and this ugly tale soon spread far and wide and came to be very
generally accepted.<a name="FNanchor_921" id="FNanchor_921"></a><a href="#Footnote_921" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> But how account for such cruel and inhuman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
treatment from a king of such eminent justice and virtue
as Henry I? Another legend soon supplied the needed explanation.
Geoffrey de Vigeois, writing before 1184, informs us that
Henry had released Robert upon certain conditions, and that the
latter, violating the agreement, had levied a force against the
king and had been captured a second time; and he adds the significant
statement that he did not need to be captured a third time
(<i>et tertio opus non fuit</i>).<a name="FNanchor_922" id="FNanchor_922"></a><a href="#Footnote_922" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> In the versions of Matthew Paris and in
the related <i>Flores Historiarum</i> this legend has been elaborated
into an episode which is not without its ludicrous as well as its
tragic aspects. Friends of Robert, weighty men, had early protested
to the king against the duke’s imprisonment. It would
disgrace the king and the realm of England throughout the world,
they said, if a brother should hold a brother in long incarceration.
And so they prevailed upon the king to grant Robert’s release,
upon condition that the latter renounce all claim to both Normandy
and England and depart from the realm within a period of
forty days. But instead of going, Robert took advantage of his
liberty to conspire with the earl of Chester and others, with intent
to raise an army and drive Henry from the throne. But the
plot was discovered, and the king sent messengers to summon
Robert before him. When the duke saw them approaching, he
turned and fled, but his palfrey ran into the mire and stuck fast,
and so the unfortunate fugitive was taken. And when the king
learned what had happened, he ordered his brother to be placed
in close and perpetual confinement without any hope of release,
and had him deprived of his sight.<a name="FNanchor_923" id="FNanchor_923"></a><a href="#Footnote_923" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless, Henry continued to provide Robert with the best
of daily food and with royal vestments.<a name="FNanchor_924" id="FNanchor_924"></a><a href="#Footnote_924" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> And this brings us
to the tale of the scarlet robe, with which our account of the
Robert legends may fittingly end. “It so happened that on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
feast day, when the king was getting himself a new scarlet robe,
and according to his custom was sending one of the same stuff to
his brother, he tried to put on the hood, and finding the neck so
small that he ripped one of the seams, he said, ‘Take this hood to
my brother, for his head is smaller than mine.’ And when it was
brought to Robert, he put it on, and immediately discovered the
rent, which the tailor had carelessly neglected to mend, for it was
very small; and he said, ‘Whence comes this rent which I feel?’
And the king’s messenger laughingly told him all that had happened.
Then the duke cried aloud, as if he had been deeply
wounded, and said, ‘Alas! alas! now have I lived too long. Why
do I still continue to draw out my unhappy days? Behold my
brother, even my betrayer and supplanter, now treats me with
contempt, and holds me so cheap that he sends me for alms as his
dependant his old and torn clothes.’ And weeping bitterly he
vowed thenceforth to take no more food, nor would he drink; but
he raged against himself, and wasted away. And so he died, cursing
the day of his birth.”<a name="FNanchor_925" id="FNanchor_925"></a><a href="#Footnote_925" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p><a name="Footnote_875" id="Footnote_875"></a><a href="#FNanchor_875"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> This chapter makes no pretence of being based upon an exhaustive examination
of all the sources. Scattered as these are through the historical and romantic
literature of several centuries, it is not unlikely that important printed materials
have been overlooked, while many manuscripts of the poetic cycle of the Crusade
still lie unprinted. It is hoped, however, that enough material has been found and
used to give an adequate view of the legendary accretions which gathered about
Robert’s name, and to throw an interesting light upon the repute in which he was
held in after times.</p>

first by Robert’s disastrous and inglorious end, and second by the growing
popularity of the Godfrey cycle. He thinks that the “lutte des deux traditions
poétiques, de provenances différentes, dont l’une avait pour héros Robert et l’autre
Godefroi” can be seen in an episode of the <i>Chanson d’Antioche</i> which may be
briefly paraphrased as follows. Godfrey, “because he is <i>preux</i> and courageous and
of the lineage of Charlemagne,” has just been chosen to represent the Christian
army in a proposed single combat with a champion from Kerboga’s host; on hearing
which Robert is so incensed at being himself passed over that he prepares to
withdraw with his forces from the crusading army. Compared with his own splendid
lineage, the ancestors of Godfrey, he declares, are not worth a button. Thereupon
the descent of Godfrey from the Chevalier au Cygne is explained to him. And
then Godfrey himself comes and humbles himself before Robert and expresses his
willingness to yield the honor to him. At that Robert is mollified and consents to
remain. <i>La Chanson d’ Antioche</i>, ed. Paulin Paris (Paris, 1848), ii, pp. 177-183. It
is difficult to see where support for Paris’s theory can be found in the matter thus
summarized. All that concerns Robert, it seems clear, exists not for itself at all, but
as a mere literary foil for setting off the merits of Godfrey and his descent from the
Chevalier au Cygne. The evidence of the Saint-Denis window which Gaston Paris
cites must be ruled out. See Appendix G.</p>

<p>The <i>Chanson d’ Antioche</i>, in the form in which we now have it, is held to have been
composed early in the reign of Philip Augustus by Grandor of Douai, a Flemish
<i>trouvère</i>, upon the basis of an earlier poem, now lost, by Richard le Pèlerin, a minstrel
who actually took part in the First Crusade. <i>Histoire littéraire de la France</i>,
xxii (1852), pp. 355-356; Auguste Molinier, <i>Les sources de l’histoire de France</i>

in old French prose of the second half of the thirteenth century, is based ultimately
upon Fulcher of Chartres, but it is filled with matter of a purely imaginary
character. It seems to contain almost no points of contact with the other sources
from which the Robert legends are to be drawn. It represents Robert as taking
part in the battle with Kilij Arslan at Nicaea—actually Robert had not yet arrived
at Nicaea—and overthrowing him and taking his horse. It also portrays
Robert as the principal leader at Nicaea, and the one to whom Kilij Arslan sent the
messenger Amendelis to open negotiations.</p>

Their view has been rightly rejected by Gaston Paris in <i>Comptes rendus de

both by Paulin Paris (<i>Histoire littéraire</i>, xxv, p. 508) and by Célestin Hippeau (<i>La

placed it as late as the first half of the fifteenth century. “Les manuscrits de la

There is as yet no edition of this poem worthy of the name. Much difference of
opinion has been expressed as to the date of its composition. It has been ascribed
by its editor to the thirteenth century. <i>Ibid.</i>, pp. xviii, xix, xxv. But Paulin Paris
held it to be a part of the work of Grandor of Douai, compiler of the <i>Chanson
d’Antioche</i>, and thought it, too, like the latter, was based upon the lost work of
Richard le Pèlerin. <i>Histoire littéraire</i>, xxii, p. 370, and cf. p. 384. And Molinier
has somewhat carelessly assigned it to <i>circa</i> 1130. <i>Sources de l’histoire de France</i>,
no. 2154. On the other hand Henri Pigeonneau, while he would ascribe it to the
late twelfth century, still holds that it certainly is not by the author of the <i>Chanson
d’Antioche</i>, and that it is a later composition than the latter. <i>Le cycle de la
croisade et de la famille de Bouillon</i> (Saint Cloud, 1877), pp. 42-55. Certainly one
works over the poem with a growing conviction that it is late rather than early. It
is almost wholly a work of imagination, in which traditions of events centring around
Antioch are hopelessly mingled with others pertaining to the region of Jerusalem.
One can hardly say whether the imaginary battle of Ramleh contains more of the
battle of Ascalon or of the battle against Kerboga.</p>

<p>It may be noted in passing that in the battle of Ascalon Robert performed an
actual feat of arms (cf. <i>supra</i>, pp. 115-116) which may perhaps form the basis of
all the legendary exploits which we have been passing in review. The references to
the enemy’s ‘standard’ in Wace (<i>supra</i>, p. 190) and in the <i>Chanson d’Antioche</i>
(<i>supra</i>, p. 195) would seem to lend some color to this view. But it should be borne
in mind that such exploits of knightly valor are a commonplace of the <i>chansons de
geste</i>, and are attributed to Godfrey and to other chiefs as well as to Robert.</p>

<span class="smaller">NOTE ON THE SOURCES</span></h3>

<p>In a field already so well explored as that of Normandy and England
in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, there is little need to enter into
a detailed discussion of primary materials. A brief review, however,
of the sources upon which the present volume is based may be a convenience
and serve a useful purpose.</p>

<p>Among the narrative sources for the life of Robert Curthose, the
<i>Historia Ecclesiastica</i><a name="FNanchor_926" id="FNanchor_926"></a><a href="#Footnote_926" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> of Ordericus Vitalis is, of course, by far the
most important. One of the greatest historical writers of the twelfth
century, the monk of Saint-Évroul has treated of Robert’s character
and career at great length and with much vivacity and insight. And
while one may admit with Gaston Le Hardy<a name="FNanchor_927" id="FNanchor_927"></a><a href="#Footnote_927" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> that he was no friend
of the duke, indeed, that as a churchman and as a lover of peace and
of strong and orderly government he was strongly prejudiced against
him and sometimes treated him unfairly, still it must be confessed that
in the main his strictures are confirmed by other evidence and are
presumably justified. Unfortunately, Ordericus Vitalis stands almost
alone among early Norman writers in paying attention to the career
of Robert Curthose. Some assistance, however, has been gained from
William of Poitiers<a name="FNanchor_928" id="FNanchor_928"></a><a href="#Footnote_928" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and from the <i>Gesta Normannorum Ducum</i>, a
composite work once solely attributed to William of Jumièges, but
now at last made available in a critical edition which distinguishes the
parts actually written by William of Jumièges, Ordericus Vitalis, Robert
of Torigny, and others.<a name="FNanchor_929" id="FNanchor_929"></a><a href="#Footnote_929" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> The <i>Roman de Rou</i> of Wace<a name="FNanchor_930" id="FNanchor_930"></a><a href="#Footnote_930" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> has also
been drawn upon, sometimes rather freely, but it is hoped always with
due caution and discretion, for much picturesque detail concerning
events in western Normandy, about which the author clearly possessed
special information. For Robert’s relations with Maine, the
contemporary <i>Actus Pontificum Cenomannis in Urbe degentium</i><a name="FNanchor_931" id="FNanchor_931"></a><a href="#Footnote_931" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
been an almost constant guide, often confirming and even supplementing
the more extensive but less precise narrative of Ordericus Vitalis.
Matter of much importance has also from time to time been gleaned
from the works of French and Flemish writers, such as the famous
<i>Vie de Louis le Gros</i> by Abbot Suger of Saint-Denis,<a name="FNanchor_932" id="FNanchor_932"></a><a href="#Footnote_932" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> the anonymous
<i>Chronique de Morigny</i>,<a name="FNanchor_933" id="FNanchor_933"></a><a href="#Footnote_933" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and the <i>Histoire du Meurtre de Charles le Bon</i>
by Galbert of Bruges.<a name="FNanchor_934" id="FNanchor_934"></a><a href="#Footnote_934" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>The English writers of the period have naturally proved invaluable.
Of these, William of Malmesbury,<a name="FNanchor_935" id="FNanchor_935"></a><a href="#Footnote_935" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> as we should expect, possesses the
keenest insight into Robert’s character; but the <i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i>
treats<a name="FNanchor_936" id="FNanchor_936"></a><a href="#Footnote_936" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> of the events of Robert’s life with greater fulness and in more
coherent and trustworthy chronological order. Florence of Worcester<a name="FNanchor_937" id="FNanchor_937"></a><a href="#Footnote_937" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
is in general dependent upon the <i>Chronicle</i>, but occasionally
he presents a different view or supplementary matter of independent
value; and the same may be said of the <i>Historia Regum</i>, which is commonly
attributed to Simeon of Durham,<a name="FNanchor_938" id="FNanchor_938"></a><a href="#Footnote_938" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> in its relation to Florence of
Worcester. Henry of Huntingdon,<a name="FNanchor_939" id="FNanchor_939"></a><a href="#Footnote_939" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> who is also largely dependent
upon the <i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i>, professes himself a first-hand authority
from the accession of Robert Curthose and William Rufus to the
ducal and royal thrones in 1087;<a name="FNanchor_940" id="FNanchor_940"></a><a href="#Footnote_940" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> and his narrative becomes increasingly
valuable as it advances, though he cannot be considered a
really independent writer before 1126, i.e., a score of years after the
close of Duke Robert’s active career at the battle of Tinchebray. For
all the facts bearing upon Robert’s life with which it deals, the <i>Historia
Novorum in Anglia</i> of Eadmer,<a name="FNanchor_941" id="FNanchor_941"></a><a href="#Footnote_941" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> the companion and confidential
adviser of Archbishop Anselm, is a strictly contemporary narrative of
the highest value, though its specialized character considerably restricts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
its usefulness for the purposes of the present study. The brief
chronicle of Hyde abbey,<a name="FNanchor_942" id="FNanchor_942"></a><a href="#Footnote_942" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> which was compiled during the reign of
Henry I, has often proved helpful, as have also other minor monastic
narratives such as the chronicle of Abingdon<a name="FNanchor_943" id="FNanchor_943"></a><a href="#Footnote_943" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> and the annals of
Winchester,<a name="FNanchor_944" id="FNanchor_944"></a><a href="#Footnote_944" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> of Waverley,<a name="FNanchor_945" id="FNanchor_945"></a><a href="#Footnote_945" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> etc.</p>

<p>The documentary sources for the life of Robert Curthose are very
meagre; but, such as they are, they are now all conveniently accessible.
As a result of prolonged researches in the archives and libraries
of Normandy and in the Bibliothèque Nationale, and after a careful
sifting of all the printed materials, Professor Charles H. Haskins has
been able to give us, in another volume of the <i>Harvard Historical
Studies</i>, a definitive edition of seven hitherto unpublished ducal charters,
together with a complete and annotated list of all the charters of
the reign.<a name="FNanchor_946" id="FNanchor_946"></a><a href="#Footnote_946" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> The best guides to the remainder of the documentary material
bearing upon Robert’s life are the <i>Regesta Regum Anglo-Normannorum</i>
by H. W. C. Davis<a name="FNanchor_947" id="FNanchor_947"></a><a href="#Footnote_947" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> and the <i>Calendar of Documents preserved
in France illustrative of the History of Great Britain and Ireland</i> by J.
H. Round.<a name="FNanchor_948" id="FNanchor_948"></a><a href="#Footnote_948" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> While both these works leave something to be desired,
they have proved invaluable in the preparation of the present study;
and it is earnestly to be hoped that the publication of the second
volume of Davis’s work, containing the charters of Henry I, will not
be long delayed.<a name="FNanchor_949" id="FNanchor_949"></a><a href="#Footnote_949" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> For the full texts of documents, and for other scattered
materials not calendared by either Round or Davis, it has been
necessary to consult many special collections, e.g., the <i>Livre noir</i>
of Bayeux cathedral,<a name="FNanchor_950" id="FNanchor_950"></a><a href="#Footnote_950" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> the <i>Chartes de Saint-Julien de Tours</i>,<a name="FNanchor_951" id="FNanchor_951"></a><a href="#Footnote_951" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
<i>Cartulaire de l’abbaye de Saint-Vincent du Mans</i>,<a name="FNanchor_952" id="FNanchor_952"></a><a href="#Footnote_952" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> the letters of Pascal
II,<a name="FNanchor_953" id="FNanchor_953"></a><a href="#Footnote_953" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> of Ivo of Chartres,<a name="FNanchor_954" id="FNanchor_954"></a><a href="#Footnote_954" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> and of St. Anselm,<a name="FNanchor_955" id="FNanchor_955"></a><a href="#Footnote_955" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> which are too numerous
to be listed here in detail, and which have been fully cited in their
proper places in footnotes.</p>

<p>The Crusade forms a special chapter in the record of Robert’s life
for which it is necessary to draw upon a different group of sources. Of
works by contemporary or early writers on the Crusade, the anonymous
<i>Gesta Francorum</i><a name="FNanchor_956" id="FNanchor_956"></a><a href="#Footnote_956" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> is, of course, invaluable for all the facts with
which it deals; but the <i>Historia Hierosolymitana</i> of Fulcher of Chartres<a name="FNanchor_957" id="FNanchor_957"></a><a href="#Footnote_957" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
has proved of even greater service in the present study, because
of the author’s close association with Robert Curthose on the Crusade
from the time when the expedition left Normandy until it reached
Marash in Armenia; concerning later events also Fulcher was by no
means ill informed. The <i>Historia Francorum qui ceperunt Iherusalem</i>
of Raymond of Aguilers<a name="FNanchor_958" id="FNanchor_958"></a><a href="#Footnote_958" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> is also a first-hand narrative by an eyewitness;
and, while the author is at times rather hostile to Duke
Robert and the Normans, he is nevertheless invaluable as representing
the point of view of the Provençaux. Inferior to any of the foregoing,
but still by a writer who was in the East and who was well informed,
the <i>Gesta Tancredi</i> of Ralph of Caen<a name="FNanchor_959" id="FNanchor_959"></a><a href="#Footnote_959" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> has proved of great assistance,
as has also the voluminous, but less trustworthy, work of Albert of
Aix,<a name="FNanchor_960" id="FNanchor_960"></a><a href="#Footnote_960" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> which, when it has been possible to check it with other evidence,
has contributed valuable information. Of western writers on the
Crusade who did not actually make the pilgrimage to the Holy Land,
apart from Ordericus Vitalis,<a name="FNanchor_961" id="FNanchor_961"></a><a href="#Footnote_961" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> who has already been mentioned, Guibert
of Nogent<a name="FNanchor_962" id="FNanchor_962"></a><a href="#Footnote_962" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> and Baldric, archbishop of Dol,<a name="FNanchor_963" id="FNanchor_963"></a><a href="#Footnote_963" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> have been most
helpful. The English writers, except William of Malmesbury,<a name="FNanchor_964" id="FNanchor_964"></a><a href="#Footnote_964" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>—whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
account is based almost wholly upon Fulcher of Chartres, and,
apart from an occasional detail, is of little value—have not treated
the Crusade with any fulness, and are of little service except for the
beginnings of the movement. Of the Greek sources only the <i>Alexiad</i>
of Anna Comnena<a name="FNanchor_965" id="FNanchor_965"></a><a href="#Footnote_965" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> has been of much assistance. The Oriental writers
are in general too late to be of great importance for the First
Crusade, and they had, of course, no particular interest in Robert
Curthose; but their writings have not been overlooked, and Matthew
of Edessa,<a name="FNanchor_966" id="FNanchor_966"></a><a href="#Footnote_966" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Ibn el-Athir,<a name="FNanchor_967" id="FNanchor_967"></a><a href="#Footnote_967" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Kemal ed-Din,<a name="FNanchor_968" id="FNanchor_968"></a><a href="#Footnote_968" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> and Usama ibn Munkidh<a name="FNanchor_969" id="FNanchor_969"></a><a href="#Footnote_969" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
have been of service. The contemporary letters bearing upon
the Crusade have been admirably edited, with exhaustive critical
notes, by Heinrich Hagenmeyer.<a name="FNanchor_970" id="FNanchor_970"></a><a href="#Footnote_970" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Of charters, or documents in the
strict sense of the word, there are almost none relating to the Crusade;
but such as there are, they have been rendered easily accessible by the
painstaking calendar of documents dealing with the history of the
Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem by Reinhold Röhricht.<a name="FNanchor_971" id="FNanchor_971"></a><a href="#Footnote_971" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> It would be
going too far afield to describe at this point the scattered materials
from which the attempt has been made to draw up a list of the known
associates and followers of Robert on the Crusade. They are fully
cited in Appendix D.</p>

<p>For the chapter on Robert Curthose in legend, with which the narrative
part of the present volume ends, it has been necessary to depart
from the narrow chronological limits within which the rest of our researches
have been conducted, and to explore a wide range of literature
extending to the close of the Middle Ages. Most of the Robert
legends make their appearance early, and can be traced to a certain
extent in William of Malmesbury and Henry of Huntingdon and in
Robert the Monk and Ralph of Caen. But their elaboration was in
the main the work of chroniclers and romancers of a later period.
Among Norman and English sources, the works of Geoffrey Gaimar,
Wace, William of Newburgh, Ralph de Diceto, and Ralph Niger have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
proved most helpful for the twelfth century; of Roger of Wendover,
Matthew Paris, and Robert of Gloucester, together with the anonymous
<i>Flores Historiarum</i> and <i>Livere de reis de Engletere</i>, for the thirteenth;
of Peter Langtoft, Ranulf Higden, and Henry Knighton, together
with the anonymous <i>Eulogium Historiarum</i>, for the fourteenth;
while Thomas Walsingham in the fifteenth century has occasionally
been of service. Much material of a legendary character relating to
Robert’s exploits in the Holy War has also been gleaned from the
various versions of the poetic cycle of the Crusade, the most notable
of which are the <i>Chanson d’Antioche</i> of the late twelfth century, the
<i>Chanson de Jérusalem</i>, which probably dates from the thirteenth century,
and the <i>Chevalier au Cygne et Godefroid de Bouillon</i>, edited by
the Baron de Reiffenberg, which belongs to the fourteenth or fifteenth
century. Such detailed criticism as it has seemed necessary to make
of these widely scattered materials bearing upon Robert Curthose in
legend has been placed in the footnotes of Chapter VIII, where the
editions used have also been fully cited.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>DE INIUSTA VEXATIONE WILLELMI EPISCOPI PRIMI</i><a name="FNanchor_972" id="FNanchor_972"></a><a href="#Footnote_972" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></span></h3>

<p>The anonymous tract <i>De Iniusta Vexatione Willelmi Episcopi Primi</i><a name="FNanchor_973" id="FNanchor_973"></a><a href="#Footnote_973" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
is worthy of more attention and of a more critical study than it has
yet received.<a name="FNanchor_974" id="FNanchor_974"></a><a href="#Footnote_974" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Since it gives the only detailed account which we possess
of the dispute between William Rufus and William of Saint-Calais,
bishop of Durham, and of the trial of the latter before the
<i>curia regis</i> at Salisbury upon a charge of treason in connection with
the rebellion of 1088, final judgment as to the bishop’s guilt or innocence
must in large measure depend upon a just estimate of its value.
Freeman was very reluctant to recognize its high authority as compared
with his favorite ‘southern writers,’ the Anglo-Saxon chronicler,
Florence of Worcester, and William of Malmesbury;<a name="FNanchor_975" id="FNanchor_975"></a><a href="#Footnote_975" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> but his distrust
appears to be unwarranted.</p>

<p>The tract is manifestly made up of two distinct parts: (1) the main
body of an original <i>libellus</i>, concerned exclusively with the bishop’s
‘vexation,’ and beginning (p. 171), “Rex Willelmus iunior dissaisivit
Dunelmensem episcopum,” and ending (p. 194), “rex permisit episcopo
transitum”; and (2) introductory and concluding chapters,
which contain a brief sketch of the bishop’s career before and after
his unfortunate quarrel with the king and his expulsion from the realm.
The joints at which the separate narratives are pieced together are apparent
upon the most cursory examination. Not only is there a
striking contrast between the detailed and documentary treatment
found in the body of the <i>libellus</i> and the bare summaries which make
up the introductory and concluding paragraphs, but the reader is
actually warned of the transition in the last sentence of the introduction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
by the phrase (p. 171), “quam rem <i>sequens libellus</i> manifestat ex
ordine.” The two parts of the tract are evidently derived from different
sources and written at different times by different authors.</p>

<p>The <i>libellus</i> properly so called, i.e., the central portion of the tract,
is a narrative well supplied with documents; it has all the appearance
of being contemporary and by an eyewitness, and is manifestly a
source of the greatest value for the facts with which it deals. Liebermann,
with his unrivalled knowledge of mediaeval English legal materials,
has declared that there is no ground for doubting its authenticity;<a name="FNanchor_976" id="FNanchor_976"></a><a href="#Footnote_976" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
and Professor G. B. Adams, who also finds abundant internal
evidence of its genuineness, points out, as an indication that it was
written by an eyewitness in the company of Bishop William, the fact
that no attempt is made to tell what went on within the <i>curia</i> while
the bishop and his supporters were outside; and further, he considers
it more “objective and impartial” than Eadmer’s better known account
of the trial of Anselm before the council of Rockingham.<a name="FNanchor_977" id="FNanchor_977"></a><a href="#Footnote_977" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The
author, it may be conjectured, was a monk of Durham who stood in
somewhat the same favored position among the intimates of Bishop
William as that occupied by Eadmer with regard to Anselm; and
while we know nothing of his personality, it is perhaps worth remarking
in passing that he may very well be the ‘certain monk’ (<i>quendam
suum monachum</i>) who acts on at least two occasions as the bishop’s
messenger (pp. 172, 175). The account in the earlier instance is so
intimate and personal as strongly to support this hypothesis: “Ipsum
quoque monachum episcopi, qui de rege redibat, accepit et equum
suum ei occidit; postea peditem abire permisit.”</p>

<p>The introduction and the conclusion of the tract, on the other hand,
are not a first-hand narrative; and fortunately we possess the source
from which they are derived. The introduction (pp. 170 f.), dealing
with the bishop’s career prior to 1088, contains nothing which is not
told with much greater fulness in the opening chapters of the fourth
book of the <i>Historia Dunelmensis Ecclesiae</i> of Simeon of Durham.<a name="FNanchor_978" id="FNanchor_978"></a><a href="#Footnote_978" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
It is in fact a mere summary of those chapters; and while the author
is no servile copyist, he evidently had no other source of information.
It seems safe to conclude, therefore, that he was not identical with
the author of the original <i>libellus</i>. Judged by style and method, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
conclusion of the tract (pp. 194 f.) appears to be by the same author
as the introduction. It, too, is clearly an abridgment of certain chapters
of the <i>Historia Dunelmensis Ecclesiae</i>,<a name="FNanchor_979" id="FNanchor_979"></a><a href="#Footnote_979" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> though with this notable
difference from the introduction, that it contains some matter not to
be found in the <i>Historia</i>, e.g., the statement that the exiled bishop
was intrusted by the duke with the administration of all Normandy,
and the notices of the expedition of William Rufus against King Malcolm
in 1091, and of the presence of the Scottish king at the laying of
the first stones in the foundation of the new cathedral at Durham in
1093. Apparently, for these more recent events, the writer was drawing
upon his own first-hand knowledge. The date at which the introductory
and concluding chapters were appended to the original Durham
<i>libellus</i> cannot be fixed with exactness. The reference to Anselm
as “sanctae memoriae” (p. 195) shows that they were written after
his death in 1109;<a name="FNanchor_980" id="FNanchor_980"></a><a href="#Footnote_980" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and since, as will appear below, they in turn were
used in the <i>Historia Regum</i>, which is commonly attributed to Simeon
of Durham, the <i>terminus ad quem</i> cannot be placed much later than
1129.<a name="FNanchor_981" id="FNanchor_981"></a><a href="#Footnote_981" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>The relationship between the above mentioned additions to the
Durham <i>libellus</i> and the <i>Historia Regum</i> may be displayed by the following
quotations.</p>

<p>The introduction to the Durham tract closes with the following
sentence (p. 171):</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>… sed orta inter regem et primates Angliae magna dissensione, episcopus
[i.e., William of Durham] ab invidis circumventus usque ad expulsionem
iram regis pertulit, <i>quam rem sequens libellus manifestat ex ordine</i>;</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">and the conclusion opens as follows (pp. 194 f.):</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Anno sui episcopatus octavo expulsus est ab Anglia, sed a Roberto fratre
regis, comite Normannorum, honorifice susceptus, totius Normanniae curam
suscepit. Tertio autem anno, repacificatus regi, recepit episcopatum suum</i>,
ipso rege cum fratre suo totoque Angliae exercitu, cum Scotiam contra
Malcolmum tenderent, <i>eum in sedem suam restituentibus, ipsa videlicet die
qua inde pulsus fuerat. Tertio Idus Septembris</i>, secundo anno suae reversionis,
ecclesiam veterem, quam Aldunus quondam episcopus construxerat,
a fundamentis destruxit.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>The account of the rebellion of 1088 in the <i>Historia Regum</i>—at this
point almost wholly independent of Florence of Worcester—ends
with the expulsion, not of Bishop William of Durham, but of Bishop
Odo of Bayeux:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>… et ita episcopus [i.e., Odo] qui fere fuit secundus rex Angliae, honorem
amisit irrecuperabiliter. <i>Sed episcopus veniens Normanniam statim a Rodberto
comite totius provinciae curam suscepit; cuius ordinem causae libellus
in hoc descriptus aperte ostendit. Etiam Dunholmensis episcopus Willelmus,
viii. anno episcopatus, et multi alii, de Anglia exierunt.</i><a name="FNanchor_982" id="FNanchor_982"></a><a href="#Footnote_982" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

</div>

<p>And in a later passage the king’s restoration of Bishop William to his
see is thus recorded:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Veniens Dunelmum, episcopum Willelmum restituit in sedem suam, ipso
post annos tres die quo eam reliquit, scilicet iii. idus Septembris.</i><a name="FNanchor_983" id="FNanchor_983"></a><a href="#Footnote_983" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Thomas Arnold, the editor of Simeon’s <i>Opera</i>, remarks upon the
clause “cuius ordinem causae libellus in hoc descriptus aperte ostendit”
of the <i>Historia Regum</i>, “This ‘libellus,’ describing Odo’s administration
in Normandy, appears to be lost.”<a name="FNanchor_984" id="FNanchor_984"></a><a href="#Footnote_984" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Taken by itself
the passage is obscure, and it is perhaps not surprising that the editor
wholly mistook its meaning. But a comparison of it with the clause
“quam rem sequens libellus manifestat ex ordine” of the Durham
tract at once reveals dependence and resolves the difficulty. The
verbal similarities are striking, and the author of course uses the puzzling
“causae” because the source from which he drew was in fact the
account of a <i>causa</i>, viz., the trial of William of Saint-Calais before the
<i>curia regis</i>. It is clear, therefore, that the <i>libellus</i> to which the author
of the <i>Historia Regum</i> refers his readers is not a lost treatise on the
administration of Bishop Odo in Normandy—as Arnold supposed—but
in fact the Durham tract on the ‘unjust vexation’ of Bishop William,
which Arnold had himself already published in the first volume
of Simeon’s works. A further comparison of all the passages which
have been indicated by italics in the foregoing excerpts fully confirms
this conclusion and reveals the extent of the debt of the <i>Historia
Regum</i> to the Durham tract. Not only the verbal agreements but the
close similarities in thought are so marked as to preclude every possibility
of independence.</p>

<p>We are now in a position to see how the author of the <i>Historia
Regum</i> worked. Having before him the chronicle of Florence of Worcester—which
he regularly followed—with its dark picture of Bishop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
William’s treason, and the elaborate Durham tract in his defence, he
chose to suppress all reference to the bishop of Durham in connection
with the rebellion, and substituted for him Odo of Bayeux as a scapegoat.
Then at the end of his chapter he added, apparently as an afterthought,
and borrowing directly from the Durham tract, that Bishop
William ‘departed’ from England in the eighth year of his episcopate.
The statement of the <i>Historia Regum</i>, therefore, that Odo of Bayeux
upon his expulsion from England after the fall of Rochester went to
Normandy and had the ‘care’ of the whole duchy committed to his
charge, is valueless. If that honor belongs to any one, it is to William
of Saint-Calais, bishop of Durham, as set forth in the conclusion of the
tract <i>De Iniusta Vexatione</i>.<a name="FNanchor_985" id="FNanchor_985"></a><a href="#Footnote_985" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>But the author of the <i>Historia Regum</i> was a clumsy borrower, and
we have not yet reached the end of the confusion which has arisen as
the result of his easy way of juggling with his sources. In a later passage
in which he deals with the return of Bishop William to his see at
the time of the expedition of William Rufus against King Malcolm in
1091, he explains that the restoration of the bishop took place on the
third anniversary of his retirement, “that is, on the 3d before the Ides
of September.” Freeman, relying upon this text, but apparently mistaking
Ides for Nones, states that the arrival of the king in Durham
and the reinstatement of the bishop took place on 3 September.<a name="FNanchor_986" id="FNanchor_986"></a><a href="#Footnote_986" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
Comparison with the parallel text of the Durham tract, however,
makes it clear that the author of the <i>Historia Regum</i> has here again
made an unintelligent and altogether misleading use of his source,
copying almost verbatim, but detaching the phrase “iii. idus Septembris”
from the next sentence, where it properly refers to an event of
the year 1093. It is necessary, therefore, to get back to the evidence
of the <i>De Iniusta Vexatione</i>, which not only says that Bishop William
was reinstated on the third anniversary of his expulsion, but fixes that
earlier date with exactness: “Acceperunt ergo Ivo Taillesboci et
Ernesius de Burone castellum Dunelmense in manus regis, et dissaisiverunt
episcopum de ecclesia et de castello, et de omni terra sua
xviii. kal. Decembr.” (p. 192). The bishop’s restoration, accordingly,
should be dated 14 November 1091. If it cause surprise that William<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
Rufus should have undertaken a campaign in the northern country
so late in the season, it may be noted that he previously had his hands
full with an expedition against the Welsh,<a name="FNanchor_987" id="FNanchor_987"></a><a href="#Footnote_987" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> and that Florence of Worcester
in describing the campaign makes the significant statement,
“multique de equestri exercitus eius fame et frigore perierunt.”<a name="FNanchor_988" id="FNanchor_988"></a><a href="#Footnote_988" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>It remains to raise a question as to the authorship of the <i>Historia
Regum</i>. As is well known, the evidence on which both it and the <i>Historia
Dunelmensis Ecclesiae</i> are attributed to Simeon of Durham is not
contemporary and not conclusive,<a name="FNanchor_989" id="FNanchor_989"></a><a href="#Footnote_989" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> though a better case can be made
out for the latter than for the former. Without discussing this evidence
anew, and without entering at this time upon the more extended
inquiry as to whether it is credible that two works of such different
character and of such unequal merit can be by a single author, it is still
pertinent here to remark their striking difference in point of view with
regard to the controversy between William Rufus and the bishop of
Durham. The <i>Historia Dunelmensis Ecclesiae</i> speaks of the quarrel
and of the bishop’s expulsion and exile without any reserve; and, moreover,
it contains remarkably full information concerning his fortunes
while in exile.<a name="FNanchor_990" id="FNanchor_990"></a><a href="#Footnote_990" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> In all this it is freely reproduced in the additions to
the Durham <i>libellus</i> (pp. 171, 194 f.). And they in turn are used by the
author of the <i>Historia Regum</i>.<a name="FNanchor_991" id="FNanchor_991"></a><a href="#Footnote_991" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Yet with these additions and the
original <i>libellus</i> and Florence of Worcester all before him, he suppresses
every reference to the alleged treason of Bishop William, persistently
declines to use such words as expulsion and exile in connection with
him, and steadily ignores the quarrel. For him the bishop ‘went out’
of England, although he unconsciously slips into an inconsistency in a
later passage when he notes that the bishop was ‘restored’ to the see
which he had ‘left.’<a name="FNanchor_992" id="FNanchor_992"></a><a href="#Footnote_992" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> If the <i>Historia Dunelmensis Ecclesiae</i> and the
<i>Historia Regum</i> are by one and the same author, then assuredly he had
a bad memory for what he had himself previously written, and his
point of view had curiously shifted during the intervening years.</p>

<span class="smaller">ARNULF OF CHOCQUES, CHAPLAIN OF ROBERT CURTHOSE</span></h3>

<p>Arnulf of Chocques, who went on the First Crusade with Robert Curthose
and ended his dramatic career in 1118 as patriarch of Jerusalem,
is a character of more than ordinary interest, and his provenance and
early career are worthy of more careful investigation than they have
yet received.<a name="FNanchor_993" id="FNanchor_993"></a><a href="#Footnote_993" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The foundation for such a study was laid in 1904,
when, by the publication in a new and scholarly edition of a little-known
text of the early twelfth century, entitled <i>Versus de Viris
Illustribus Diocesis Tarvanensis</i>, the Belgian scholar Charles Moeller
identified Arnulf’s birthplace as the village of Chocques in the diocese
of Thérouanne on the river Clarence, an affluent of the Lys.<a name="FNanchor_994" id="FNanchor_994"></a><a href="#Footnote_994" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Thus
Moeller returns to the view of the Flemish annalists Meyer and
Malbrancq,<a name="FNanchor_995" id="FNanchor_995"></a><a href="#Footnote_995" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> who manifestly knew and used this text; though modern
writers upon the Crusades, overlooking it and relying mainly upon
Albert of Aix,<a name="FNanchor_996" id="FNanchor_996"></a><a href="#Footnote_996" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> have said that Arnulf was ‘of Rohes, a castle of Flanders,’
which no one has ever been able to identify.<a name="FNanchor_997" id="FNanchor_997"></a><a href="#Footnote_997" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> If further evidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
were needed to establish the correctness of Moeller’s conclusion, it is
found in a charter of 15 August 1095 by Robert Curthose in favor of
Rouen cathedral, among the witnesses to which appears “Ernulfo de
Cioches capellano meo.”<a name="FNanchor_998" id="FNanchor_998"></a><a href="#Footnote_998" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> This document is also important as confirming
and supplementing the meagre notices of the chroniclers, on
which one is compelled to rely almost entirely for all that is known
about Arnulf of Chocques before he went on the Crusade and came
into prominence and controversy.</p>

<p>As to Arnulf’s family, practically nothing is known; though one
may safely infer that he was of lowly origin from the speech which his
friend and former pupil, Ralph of Caen, puts into his mouth when he
makes him say to the princely leaders of the Crusade, “You have
promoted me from a humble station, and from one unknown you have
made me famous, and, as it were, one of yourselves.”<a name="FNanchor_999" id="FNanchor_999"></a><a href="#Footnote_999" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> His enemies
openly charged that he was the son of a priest;<a name="FNanchor_1000" id="FNanchor_1000"></a><a href="#Footnote_1000" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and that their accusations
were not without foundation is evidenced by a letter of Pope
Pascal II, replying in 1116 to complaints which had been made against
Arnulf, and reinstating him in the patriarchal office from which he had
been suspended by the papal legate. While clearing him entirely from
two of the charges which had been brought against him, the pope announced
that the third complaint, viz., the general belief as to a stain
upon his birth, was to be overlooked, ‘by apostolic dispensation,’ in
view of Arnulf’s great services and of the needs of the church.<a name="FNanchor_1001" id="FNanchor_1001"></a><a href="#Footnote_1001" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> The
statement sometimes made that Arnulf had a niece named Emma, or
Emelota,<a name="FNanchor_1002" id="FNanchor_1002"></a><a href="#Footnote_1002" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> who figures in the charters of the Latin Kingdom,<a name="FNanchor_1003" id="FNanchor_1003"></a><a href="#Footnote_1003" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and
who was the wife, first of Eustace Gamier, lord of Caesarea, and then
of Hugh II, count of Jaffa, appears to rest upon the sole authority of
William of Tyre.<a name="FNanchor_1004" id="FNanchor_1004"></a><a href="#Footnote_1004" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>Considering the age in which he lived, Arnulf doubtless received an
excellent education,<a name="FNanchor_1005" id="FNanchor_1005"></a><a href="#Footnote_1005" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> though where it is impossible to say; and while
still a young man he appeared in Normandy as a teacher, presumably
at Caen. Ralph of Caen, who later became the distinguished historian
of the First Crusade, was among his pupils; and upon the completion
of his great work, the <i>Gesta Tancredi</i>, dedicated it in grateful remembrance
to his old master.<a name="FNanchor_1006" id="FNanchor_1006"></a><a href="#Footnote_1006" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>Far more important for Arnulf’s future, however, was the connection
which he early established with the Anglo-Norman ruling family
when he was made tutor in grammar and dialectic to the oldest
daughter of William the Conqueror, Cecilia, the pious nun of La
Trinité at Caen, who later became the second abbess of her mother’s
great foundation.<a name="FNanchor_1007" id="FNanchor_1007"></a><a href="#Footnote_1007" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> It was probably through the friendship thus
established with the royal princess that the Flemish schoolmaster succeeded
in rising to higher things; for Cecilia is said to have obtained
from her indulgent brother, Duke Robert, the promise of episcopal
honors for Arnulf, in case any of the Norman bishoprics should fall
vacant;<a name="FNanchor_1008" id="FNanchor_1008"></a><a href="#Footnote_1008" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> and while he never gained that preferment, it can hardly
be doubted that it was through her influence that he entered the service
of the duke as chaplain. The charter to which attention has been
called above furnishes proof that Arnulf already held that position in
August 1096 (<i>supra</i>, n. 6). But his official connection with the ducal
court undoubtedly began at least a year earlier, for the contemporary
biographer of Abbot William of Bec states very specifically that on, or
shortly after, 10 August 1094 he went on an important official errand
for the duke in the capacity of ‘chancellor.’<a name="FNanchor_1009" id="FNanchor_1009"></a><a href="#Footnote_1009" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>One other fact remains to be noticed as indicating Arnulf’s intimate
relationship with another member of the Conqueror’s family. Although
he was chaplain of the duke before and during the Crusade,
he is said to have set out for the Holy War in the company of Robert’s
uncle, Bishop Odo of Bayeux, who upon his death at Palermo, early
in 1097, left him the greater part of his splendid outfit.<a name="FNanchor_1010" id="FNanchor_1010"></a><a href="#Footnote_1010" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

de Ierusalem Rotomagum venit, et a praefato patre [i.e., Abbot Hilgot
of Saint-Ouen, 1092-1112] ad monachatum susceptus, ecclesiae suae

<p>21. <span class="smcap">Gilbert</span>, bishop of Évreux. He was present at the council of
Clermont as <i>legatus</i> of his fellow bishops. Ordericus, iii, p. 470. He
was with Bishop Odo of Bayeux at the time of the latter’s death at
Palermo early in 1097. <i>Ibid.</i>, iv, pp. 17-18; iii, p. 266. Cf. no. 29
<i>infra</i>. If Gilbert completed the Crusade, he must have returned from
Jerusalem far more quickly than most of his comrades, for he was
back in Normandy by the middle of November 1099. Ordericus, iv,
p. 65; cf. v, pp. 159, 195-196.</p>

<p>22. *<span class="smcap">Guy</span>, eldest son of Gerard le Duc. He received five <i>solidi</i> from
Saint-Vincent of Le Mans “cum pergeret ad Ierusalem cum Pagano
de Monte Dublelli.” <i>Cartulaire de S.-Vincent</i>, no. 666. The editors,
without good reason, date the document “circa 1096.” Cf. no. 30

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>23. *<span class="smcap">Guy de Sarcé</span>, a knight of Saint-Vincent of Le Mans. He
surrendered his fief to the abbot and monks of Saint-Vincent, and received
from them 20 <i>livres manceaux</i> and 300 <i>solidi</i>. This was done in
the chapter on 22 June 1096, “eo videlicet anno quo Urbanus papa
adventu suo occiduas illustravit partes, quoque etiam innumerabiles
turbas populorum admonitione sua, immo vero Dei suffragante
auxilio, Ierosolimitanum iter super paganos adire monuit.” It is not
improbable that Guy’s brothers, Nicholas and Pain, accompanied him
on the Crusade. <i>Cartulaire de S.-Vincent</i>, no. 317. This charter was
witnessed, among others, by William de Braitel, who is no. 47 of our
list <i>infra</i>.</p>

<p>24. *<span class="smcap">Hamo de Huna.</span> He made a grant to Saint-Vincent of Le
Mans on 29 July 1096; and “post non multum vero temporis …
antequam Ierusalem iret quo tendere volebat,” he added another gift,
and received from the monks 20 <i>solidi</i>. “Hoc actum fuit in domo
monachorum apud Bazogers, in adventu Domini iv die ante natale
Domini.” <i>Cartulaire de S.-Vincent</i>, no. 460. This was 22 December,
presumably of the year 1096. Hamo, therefore, did not accompany
the other crusaders in the autumn, but he may very well have overtaken
them in Italy the following spring.</p>

<p>25. <span class="smcap">Hervé</span>, son of Dodeman. He is named among those who advanced
with Robert after the capture of Nicaea. Baldric of Dol, in

count of Léon, in place of Hervé, son of Dodeman.</p>

<p>26. <span class="smcap">Hugh II</span>, count of Saint-Pol. He set out from Normandy with
Robert in 1096. Ordericus, iii, p. 484. He was present at the siege of
Nicaea, and advanced with Robert from there. <i>Ibid.</i>, pp. 502-503,
507; Baldric of Dol, in <i>H. C. Oc.</i>, iv, pp. 28, 33. He was present at

<p>27. *<span class="smcap">Ingelbaudus</span>: “Ego Ingelbaudus illud Sepulchrum volo petere.”
In view of the proposed journey he made various grants to
Saint-Vincent of Le Mans. <i>Cartulaire de S.-Vincent</i>, no. 101. The

was in touch with Abbot Gerento of Saint-Bénigne of Dijon, the Pope’s
special agent, who was promoting the Crusade in Normandy during
the summer of 1096. Haskins, pp. 75-76. But it seems probable that
he undertook the Crusade rather to escape the wrath of William Rufus
than from any religious zeal. Ordericus, iv, pp. 16-17. He died at
Palermo, in February 1097 according to Ordericus Vitalis (<i>ibid.</i>),
though his obit was celebrated in Bayeux cathedral on Epiphany (6
January). Ulysse Chevalier, <i>Ordinaire et coutumier de l’église cathédrale
de Bayeux</i> (Paris, 1902), p. 410. He was buried by his fellow
bishop, Gilbert of Évreux, in the cathedral church of St. Mary at
Palermo, and Count Roger reared a splendid monument over his
grave. Ordericus, iv, pp. 17-18; iii, p. 266; cf. Guibert of Nogent,
in <i>H. C. Oc.</i>, iv, p. 233. Odo’s epitaph is published, from a late
seventeenth century MS., by V. Bourrienne, in <i>Revue catholique de
Normandie</i>, x, p. 276.</p>

<p>30. *<span class="smcap">Pain de Mondoubleau.</span> See the quotation from <i>Cartulaire de
S.-Vincent</i>, no. 666, in no. 22 <i>supra</i>. The editors accept this as convincing
evidence that Pain de Mondoubleau went on the First Crusade,
but in the absence of any definite date there is no proof. And
indeed it seems hardly likely that we have to do here with the First
Crusade, since in 1098, according to Ordericus Vitalis—who, however,
is a very untrustworthy guide in matters of chronology—Pain
was in Maine and handed over the castle of Ballon to William Rufus.
Ordericus, iv, p. 47; cf. Latouche, <i>Maine</i>, p. 47; Auguste de Trémault,
“Recherches sur les premiers seigneurs de Mondoubleau,” in
<i>Bulletin de la Société archéologique du Vendômois</i>, xxv (1886), pp. 301-302.
The latter mentions no evidence of Pain’s having gone on any
crusade.</p>

<p>31. <span class="smcap">Pain Peverel.</span> The distinguished Norman knight who acted
as Robert’s standard-bearer on the Crusade, and who upon his return
was granted a barony in England by Henry I, and became the patron
of Barnwell priory. He is described as “egregio militi, armis insigni,
milicia pollenti, viribus potenti, et super omnes regni proceres bellico
usu laudabili.” He endowed the church of Barnwell with notable
relics which he brought back from the Holy Land: “reliquias verissimas
super aurum et topazion preciosas, quas in expedicione Antiochena
adquisierat cum Roberto Curthose, dum signiferi vicem gereret,
necnon quas a patriarcha et rege et magnatibus illius terre impetraverat.”
<i>Liber Memorandorum Ecclesie de Barnewelle</i>, ed. J. W. Clark
(Cambridge, 1907), pp. 54, 55, 41, 46. According to the editor this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
anonymous work was written in its present form in 1295-96; the
author had access to documents, and probably based his narrative on
the work of an earlier writer (introduction, pp. ix-x, xiv). The part
dealing with our period contains notable chronological inaccuracies,
but for the fundamental facts of the life of Pain Peverel it may probably
be relied upon.</p>

<p>32. <span class="smcap">Philip of Bellême</span>, called the Clerk, fifth son of Roger of

<p>35. <span class="smcap">Richard</span>, son of Fulk, of Aunou-le-Faucon: “quidam miles,
genere Normannicus, vocabulo Ricardus, filius Fulconis senioris de
Alnou.” After the capture of Jerusalem he was saved from shipwreck
off the Syrian coast through the miraculous interposition of St. Nicholas
of Bari; and upon his return to Normandy he became a monk of
Bec. <i>Miracula S. Nicolai conscripta a Monacho Beccensi</i>, in <i>Catalogus

ii, p. 75.</p>

<p>36. <span class="smcap">Riou de Lohéac.</span> He died while on the Crusade, but sent back
to Lohéac a casket of precious relics, among them a portion of the
true Cross and a fragment of the Sepulchre: “Notum sit … quod
Waulterius, Iudicaelis filius de Lohoac, quidam miles nobilissimus et
illius castri princeps et dominus… Sancto Salvatori suisque monachis
quoddam venerandum et honorabile sanctuarium, quod frater

donariis quę subter scribentur, honorificę dedit et in perpetuum
habere concessit.” These relics were placed in the church of Saint-Sauveur
at Lohéac in the presence of a great concourse of clergy and
people, among them being the famous Robert of Arbrissel, “quidam
sanctissimus homo.” The document was attested, among others, by
Walter and William, Riou’s brothers, and by Geoffrey his son, Gonnor
his wife, and Simon de Ludron. “Hoc factum est in castello de Lohoac,
iuxta ipsam aecclesiam monachorum, .iii. kal. Iul., in natali apostolorum

most of the Crusade and who returned with him at least as far as
southern Italy. See Chapter IV, <i>passim</i>.</p>

<p>38. *<span class="smcap">Robert the Vicar</span> (<i>vicarius</i>). Before he went to Jerusalem
(<i>priusquam Ierusalem pergeret</i>) he made donations to Saint-Vincent
of Le Mans—his wife, son, and brothers consenting—and received
from Abbot Ranulf and the monks four <i>livres manceaux</i>. <i>Cartulaire

of Abbot Ranulf places it between 1080 and 1106. The editors date
it “circa 1096.”</p>

<p>39. <span class="smcap">Roger of Barneville.</span> <i>G. F.</i>, p. 185; Ordericus, iii, p. 503.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>42. <span class="smcap">Stephen</span>, count of Aumale. He was one of the Norman rebels
who had previously sided with William Rufus against Robert Curthose.
Ordericus, iii, p. 475. But he was on friendly terms with the
duke by 14 July 1096—doubtless as a result of the pacification which
had been brought about by the Pope—since Robert attested a
charter by Stephen on that date. <i>Gallia Christiana</i>, xi, instr., col. 20;
cf. Haskins, p. 67, no. 5. Stephen also attested a charter by the duke
in 1096. Archives de la Seine-Inférieure, G 4069 (<i>Inventaire sommaire</i>,
iii, p. 255). Albert of Aix records his presence at Nicaea; and
Ralph of Caen names him among those who at Antioch were obligated
to Robert Curthose by gifts or homage. <i>H. C. Oc.</i>, iv, p. 316; iii, p.
642.</p>

<p>43. <span class="smcap">Stephen</span>, count of Blois and Chartres. One of the well known
leaders of the Crusade. He was closely associated with Robert Curthose
at least as far as Nicaea. He became faint-hearted and turned
back home after the expedition had reached Antioch. See Chapter IV,

<p>44. *<span class="smcap">Thurstin</span>, son of Turgis, <i>prévot</i> of Luc-sur-Mer. In 1096 he
pledged his allod (<i>alodium</i>) of forty acres at Luc for four marks and
a mount (<i>equitatura</i>): “si ipse Turstinus aut uxor eius vel filius post
vi annos rediret, redderet Sancto Stephano ad finem vi annorum iiiiᵒʳ
argenti marcas.” Probably the Crusade was in contemplation,
though it is not specifically mentioned. R. Génestal, <i>Rôle des monastères

Baldric of Dol, in <i>H. C. Oc.</i>, iv, p. 33.</p>

<p>46. <span class="smcap">Wigo de Marra</span>, a crusader from Perche. “Rediens a Ierosolimitano
itinere, tempore profectionis communis Aquilonensium et
Occidentalium,” he passed through Tours; and while he rested there
with the monks of Saint-Julien, he gave them his church at Bellou-sur-Huîne,
a gift which he afterwards confirmed upon reaching home.
<i>Chartes de S.-Julien de Tours</i>, no. 51. The document is dated 1099,
“regnante Willelmo rege Anglorum et duce Normannorum,” and is
of special interest as indicating the early date at which some of the
crusaders got back to western Europe.</p>

<p>47. *<span class="smcap">William de Braitel</span> (en Lombron), son of Geoffrey the
<i>vicomte</i>. With the consent of his brothers he made a donation to
Saint-Vincent of Le Mans in 1096, “eo videlicet anno quo papa
Urbanus occidentales partes presentia sua illustravit.” <i>Cartulaire de
S.-Vincent</i>, no. 738. The similarity of dating between this charter and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
no. 317 of the same cartulary (cf. no. 23 <i>supra</i>), as well as the fact that
many of the witnesses are identical in both, makes it seem not improbable
that they were drawn up on the same occasion. If William
actually went on the First Crusade, his return appears to have been
delayed until 1116. In that year a precious relic which he brought
back from Jerusalem for Adam, a Manceau who had become a canon
of the church of the Holy Sepulchre, was presented to the cathedral
church of Le Mans. <i>Actus Pontificum</i>, p. 407. Cf. Samuel Menjot

<p>51. <span class="smcap">William de Percy</span>, benefactor of Whitby abbey. He died
while on the Crusade. “Denique nobilissimus Willielmus de Perci
Ierosolimam petens, apud locum qui vocatur Mons Gaudii, qui est in

sepultus est.” <i>Cartularium Abbathiae de Whiteby</i>, ed. J. C. Atkinson

Benefactions,” which, according to the editor, was written in the second
half of the twelfth century, certainly before 1180. It is probably only
a legend that William’s heart was brought back and buried at Whitby
abbey. His son had evidently succeeded him by 6 January 1100.

<span class="smaller">LAODICEA AND THE FIRST CRUSADE</span></h3>

<p>Laodicea, as a commodious port on the Syrian coast directly opposite
the fertile island of Cyprus, was a maritime base of the utmost importance
to the crusaders, and it has a special interest for the life of
Robert Curthose. Its history during the period of the First Crusade
is obscure, and it may be admitted at the outset that it will not be
possible to elucidate it entirely from such meagre and contradictory
materials as have survived. Nevertheless, the problems are by no
means hopeless; and the sources, such as they are, are worthy of a
more careful and critical examination than they have yet received.<a name="FNanchor_1011" id="FNanchor_1011"></a><a href="#Footnote_1011" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>From the oriental sources it seems reasonably certain that during
the period immediately preceding the arrival of the crusaders in Syria
Laodicea was in the hands of the Turks. Previous to 1086 it had belonged
to the Munkidhites of Shaizar;<a name="FNanchor_1012" id="FNanchor_1012"></a><a href="#Footnote_1012" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> but it passed from their
hands into the possession of Malik-Shah when in that year he established
himself at Aleppo.<a name="FNanchor_1013" id="FNanchor_1013"></a><a href="#Footnote_1013" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Malik-Shah granted it to Kasim ed-daula
Aksonkor, who held it until his death in 1094.<a name="FNanchor_1014" id="FNanchor_1014"></a><a href="#Footnote_1014" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> There is no evidence
that it passed out of Turkish control between this date and the arrival
of the crusaders and their associates from the West in 1097; and, in
view of the precarious situation of the Eastern Empire and the preoccupation
of the Greek Emperor with other problems during this
period, there seems to be no ground for such a supposition. According
to Kemal ed-Din—who wrote towards the middle of the thirteenth
century, and whose statement would perhaps deserve little consideration
were it not so specific—a fleet of twenty-two ships came from
Cyprus on the 8th of the month of Ramadan in the year 490 of the
Hegira (19 August 1097), entered the port of Laodicea, pillaged the
town, and carried off all the merchandise.<a name="FNanchor_1015" id="FNanchor_1015"></a><a href="#Footnote_1015" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>The western sources dealing with Laodicea in 1097-98 are numerous;
but at some points they are contradictory, and at best they yield
but scanty information. It will be well to analyze them separately
with some care:—</p>

<p>(1) The letter of Anselm de Ribemont to Archbishop Manasses of
Rheims, written from Antioch near the end of November 1097, states
definitely that Laodicea had been taken—evidently by some one
acting in the interest of the crusaders, and pretty clearly before the
arrival of the land forces at Antioch on 21 October 1097.<a name="FNanchor_1016" id="FNanchor_1016"></a><a href="#Footnote_1016" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>This statement is confirmed by the anonymous <i>Florinensis Brevis
Narratio Belli Sacri</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1017" id="FNanchor_1017"></a><a href="#Footnote_1017" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> as it is also by the account of Raymond of
Aguilers.</p>

<p>(2) Raymond of Aguilers, who, because of his actual presence in
Syria and his close association with the count of Toulouse, is by all
odds the best and most reliable chronicler dealing with the events now
under consideration, seems to have received but little attention from
modern scholars in this connection. According to his account, which
is quite full, English mariners, who were fired with enthusiasm for the
Crusade, sailed via Gibraltar to the eastern Mediterranean, and with
much labor obtained possession of the port of Antioch (evidently Port
St. Simeon is meant) and of Laodicea before the arrival of the land
forces. And during the siege of Antioch, together with the Genoese,
they rendered important services to the crusaders by means of their
fleet, keeping open commercial intercourse with Cyprus and other
islands, and in particular protecting the ships of the Greeks from attack
by the Saracens. Finally, when the crusaders were about to
advance from Syria upon Jerusalem, the English, finding that their
ships had been reduced by wear and tear from thirty to nine or ten,
abandoned them or burned them, and joined the land forces on the
southward march.<a name="FNanchor_1018" id="FNanchor_1018"></a><a href="#Footnote_1018" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, of the actual presence of English mariners on the Syrian coast
acting in coöperation with the crusaders, there can be no doubt. Apart
from the foregoing narrative, the fact is proved beyond question
(<i>a</i>) by the well known letter of the clergy and people of Lucca in
which they state that their citizen Bruno had journeyed from Italy
to Antioch “with English ships,” had taken part in the siege, and
had stayed on for three weeks after the victory;<a name="FNanchor_1019" id="FNanchor_1019"></a><a href="#Footnote_1019" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and (<i>b</i>) by the letter
of Patriarch Dagobert, written from Jerusalem in the spring of 1100,
which mentions the presence of English ships, apparently at Jaffa.<a name="FNanchor_1020" id="FNanchor_1020"></a><a href="#Footnote_1020" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
While the English ships referred to in these letters are not necessarily,
or even probably, identical with those mentioned by Raymond of
Aguilers, the letters are still of great importance as demonstrating the
general fact of the presence and activity of English mariners at this
period in these distant waters.</p>

<p>As will appear below, Raymond’s account receives some further
confirmation from Ordericus Vitalis and from Ralph of Caen.</p>

<p>(3) The narrative of Ordericus differs widely from that of Raymond
of Aguilers. According to him, at the time when the Christians were
themselves being besieged at Antioch (6-28 June 1098), a great number
of pilgrims from England and other islands of the ocean landed at
Laodicea and were joyfully welcomed by the inhabitants, who accepted
their protection against the Turks. The chief among these
pilgrims was Edgar Atheling.<a name="FNanchor_1021" id="FNanchor_1021"></a><a href="#Footnote_1021" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Taking Laodicea under his protection,
Edgar afterwards handed it over to Robert Curthose, whom he loved
as a brother. Thus Robert gained possession of Laodicea, and came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
and dwelt there for some time with Normans, English, and Bretons.
Then, leaving his own garrison in the fortresses, Robert pursued his
way to Jerusalem. But meanwhile Ravendinos, protospatharius of
Emperor Alexius, and other Greek officers came with an expedition by
sea, and laid siege to Laodicea; and the citizens, sympathizing with
the Greeks, their compatriots, expelled the men from beyond the
Alps and admitted imperial governors.<a name="FNanchor_1022" id="FNanchor_1022"></a><a href="#Footnote_1022" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>William of Malmesbury is the only other writer who mentions a
journey of Edgar Atheling to the Holy Land, and his account is very
different from that of Ordericus Vitalis. He makes no mention of
English mariners, and he places Edgar’s arrival in the East, in company
with a certain Robert, son of Godwin, at the time of the siege of
Ramleh by the Saracens (May 1102).<a name="FNanchor_1023" id="FNanchor_1023"></a><a href="#Footnote_1023" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>(4) Raymond of Aguilers is authority for the statement that Robert
was absent from Antioch in the third month of the siege, apparently
about Christmas 1097.<a name="FNanchor_1024" id="FNanchor_1024"></a><a href="#Footnote_1024" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>A fuller explanation of this absence seems to be supplied by Ralph
of Caen, who says that Robert, disgusted with the tedium of the siege,
withdrew to Laodicea in the hope of ruling there; for the English at
that time were holding it for the Emperor, and being menaced by a
wandering band, had called in Robert as their protector. Robert accordingly
went to Laodicea and gave himself up to idleness and sleep.
Yet he was not altogether useless, for, having come upon opulence,
he shared it generously with his needy comrades at the siege. Laodicea
was then the only city on the Syrian coast which was Christian
and which obeyed the Emperor; and Cyprus had filled it with an
abundance of wine, grain, and cattle. Robert was very loath to turn
his back upon such ease and plenty; and it was only after he had been
thrice summoned, and even threatened with excommunication, that
he reluctantly yielded to the entreaties of his comrades and returned
to the hardships of the siege.<a name="FNanchor_1025" id="FNanchor_1025"></a><a href="#Footnote_1025" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>From the place which this incident occupies in Ralph’s general narrative
one would judge that it belongs to the spring of 1098; but he
does not date it exactly, and his chronology at best is confused and by
no means trustworthy. It may be conjectured that this account is to
be connected with the above mentioned briefer but more trustworthy
statement of Raymond of Aguilers, thus placing the episode in the
winter of 1097-98. Ralph’s chronology is not to be regarded as impossible,
however, since there is no record of Robert’s presence at
Antioch between 9 February and the end of May, or even the first of
June, and he may very well have enjoyed more than one sojourn in
Laodicea.</p>

<p>Further evidence of the duke’s connection with Laodicea is found
in a curious statement of Guibert of Nogent that Robert had once held
it, but that when the citizens were unable to bear his excessive exactions,
they drove his garrison from the fortresses and threw off his
domination, and out of hatred abjured the use of the money of Rouen.<a name="FNanchor_1026" id="FNanchor_1026"></a><a href="#Footnote_1026" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>Finally, the twelfth-century poet Gilo remarks that English victors
gave Laodicea to the Norman count.<a name="FNanchor_1027" id="FNanchor_1027"></a><a href="#Footnote_1027" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>(5) The problem of Laodicea in its relation to the First Crusade is
still further complicated by a statement of Anna Comnena that the
Emperor wrote—she gives no date—to Raymond of Toulouse, directing
him to hand over the city to Andronicus Tzintzilucas, and
that Raymond obeyed.<a name="FNanchor_1028" id="FNanchor_1028"></a><a href="#Footnote_1028" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Both Riant<a name="FNanchor_1029" id="FNanchor_1029"></a><a href="#Footnote_1029" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and Chalandon<a name="FNanchor_1030" id="FNanchor_1030"></a><a href="#Footnote_1030" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> accept this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
statement and assign the Emperor’s letter to the first half of 1099.
Their reason for so doing appears to be found in the strange narrative
of Albert of Aix, which is unique among the sources.</p>

<p>(6) According to Albert of Aix, while Baldwin and Tancred were
at Tarsus on the way to Antioch (<i>circa</i> September 1097) a strange fleet
approached the Cilician coast. It proved to be made up of ‘Christian
pirates’ from “Flanders, Antwerp, Frisia, and other parts of Gaul
[<i>sic</i>],” who under their commander, a certain Guinemer of Boulogne,
had been pursuing their calling for the past eight years. But when
they learned of the Crusade, they concluded a treaty with Baldwin,
and, landing, joined forces with him and advanced as far as Mamistra.
But here they turned back, and, reëmbarking, sailed away to Laodicea,
which they besieged and took. Then resting there in the enjoyment
of ease and plenty, they sent no aid to their Christian brothers at
Antioch. But presently they were attacked and cut to pieces by
‘Turcopoles’<a name="FNanchor_1031" id="FNanchor_1031"></a><a href="#Footnote_1031" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and men of the Emperor, who recovered the citadel and
threw Guinemer into prison, Godfrey and the other chiefs at Antioch
being ignorant of the whole affair. Later Guinemer was released at
the request of Godfrey.<a name="FNanchor_1032" id="FNanchor_1032"></a><a href="#Footnote_1032" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>Elsewhere Albert sets forth another version of these curious events.
Guinemer and his pirates, he tells us, had assembled their fleet in conjunction
with the Provençaux of the land of Saint-Gilles under the
dominion of Count Raymond.<a name="FNanchor_1033" id="FNanchor_1033"></a><a href="#Footnote_1033" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Then, sailing to Laodicea, they had
taken it and driven out the Turks and Saracens whom they found
there. Then, after the siege of Antioch, they had handed their prize
over to Count Raymond. Still later, Guinemer, the master of the
pirates, had been captured by the Greeks, and after long imprisonment
had been released through the intervention of Duke Godfrey.
Then, when the advance to Jerusalem had been decided upon, Raymond
had restored Laodicea to the Emperor, and so kept his faith
inviolably.<a name="FNanchor_1034" id="FNanchor_1034"></a><a href="#Footnote_1034" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>Thus, if we could rely upon Albert of Aix, Laodicea came into
the hands of the count of Toulouse after the siege of Antioch, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
Alexius might naturally be expected to write him demanding its restoration
to the Empire, as Riant and Chalandon suppose in accepting
the above mentioned statement of Anna Comnena regarding the Emperor’s
letter. It should be noted, however, that from Albert’s statement
that Raymond handed over Laodicea to Alexius when the advance
to Jerusalem had been decided upon,<a name="FNanchor_1035" id="FNanchor_1035"></a><a href="#Footnote_1035" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> it follows that the transfer
could not have taken place later than 16 January 1099, the date on
which Raymond moved southward from Kafartab;<a name="FNanchor_1036" id="FNanchor_1036"></a><a href="#Footnote_1036" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> whereas Chalandon
has shown that the letter of which Anna speaks cannot be
earlier than March 1099.<a name="FNanchor_1037" id="FNanchor_1037"></a><a href="#Footnote_1037" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Albert of Aix and Anna Comnena, therefore,
are not mutually confirmatory.</p>

<p>(7) Finally, note should be taken of the statement of Cafaro of
Genoa—who passed the winter of 1100-01 at Laodicea, but who
wrote as an old man years afterwards—that, at the time of the capture
of Antioch by the crusaders, Laodicea with its fortresses was held
by the Emperor, and was under the immediate command of Eumathios
Philocales, duke of Cyprus.<a name="FNanchor_1038" id="FNanchor_1038"></a><a href="#Footnote_1038" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>So much for an analysis of the sources. It remains to consider what
conclusions may reasonably be drawn from them. And since the efforts
which have been made to accept them all as of equal validity and
to bring them into reconciliation have plainly not been successful, it
will be well to begin with a consideration of some things which must
probably be eliminated.</p>

<p>And first, it seems clear that the account of Ordericus Vitalis, which
represents Edgar Atheling as landing at Laodicea between 6 and 28
June 1098 at the head of a great body of English pilgrims, cannot be
accepted without serious modification; for we know from reliable
English sources that towards the end of 1097 Edgar was engaged in
Scotland, assisting his kinsman, another Edgar,<a name="FNanchor_1039" id="FNanchor_1039"></a><a href="#Footnote_1039" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> to obtain the Scottish
throne;<a name="FNanchor_1040" id="FNanchor_1040"></a><a href="#Footnote_1040" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> and it would, it seems, have been impossible for him to
have made the necessary preparations for a crusade and to have
journeyed from Scotland to Laodicea within the limitations of time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
which our sources impose. It is perhaps conceivable that he should
have made a hurried trip to Italy in the winter of 1097-98 with a
small band of attendants, and sailing from there, have reached the
Syrian coast by June. But according to Ordericus he arrived at the
head of “almost 20,000 pilgrims … from England and other islands
of the ocean.” Further, if the account of Ordericus were to be brought
into chronological accord with the other sources which deal with
Robert’s sojourn at Laodicea, the arrival of Edgar Atheling would
probably have to be placed several months earlier, indeed, in the
early winter of 1097-98, almost at the very time he is known to have
been in Scotland. The chronology of Ordericus, therefore—which
in general is notoriously unreliable—seems at this point unacceptable;
and William of Malmesbury, who places Edgar’s arrival in the
East in May 1102, appears to give the necessary correction. In view
of the testimony of both Ordericus Vitalis and William of Malmesbury,
it can hardly be doubted that Edgar Atheling actually went to
the Holy Land; but that he reached Laodicea in time to have anything
to do with the calling in of Robert Curthose seems highly improbable,
if not impossible.</p>

<p>The tale of Guinemer of Boulogne and his fleet of Christian pirates,
as told by Albert of Aix, must also meet with rougher handling than
it has yet received, and for the following reasons: (1) The description
of this fleet with its “masts of wondrous height, covered with purest
gold, and refulgent in the sunlight”<a name="FNanchor_1041" id="FNanchor_1041"></a><a href="#Footnote_1041" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> is not such as to inspire confidence,
particularly in such a writer as Albert of Aix, where one expects
at any time to meet with the use of untrustworthy poetical materials.
(2) As the narrative proceeds it becomes self-contradictory. At one
point we are told that Guinemer was captured by the Greeks during
the siege of Antioch, whereas at another he seems to have held Laodicea
throughout the siege—since he turned it over to Count Raymond
after the siege—; and his capture and imprisonment by the
Greeks are placed still later. (3) Albert of Aix is in direct contradiction
with Raymond of Aguilers, the best of all our authorities, who
tells us that the English held Laodicea during the whole of the siege
of Antioch and rendered important services to the crusaders; whereas,
according to Albert’s account, Guinemer and his pirates held it and
refused to aid the crusaders. (4) Not a scrap of evidence concerning
Guinemer and his pirates has come to light in any source except Albert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
of Aix—unless perchance their fleet is to be identified with the
ships which, according to Kemal ed-Din, came from Cyprus 19 August
1097, pillaged Laodicea, and sailed away;<a name="FNanchor_1042" id="FNanchor_1042"></a><a href="#Footnote_1042" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> and this seems unlikely.
(5) In any case, outside the pages of Albert of Aix, evidence is lacking
that such a piratical fleet held Laodicea for any considerable period;
and apparently the only reason why Riant and Chalandon have accepted
this fantastical tale of Guinemer and the Christian pirates is
the fancied possibility of connecting it with the letter which, according
to Anna Comnena, the Emperor wrote at an undetermined date
to Raymond of Toulouse, directing him to hand over Laodicea to
Andronicus Tzintzilucas. But Riant and Chalandon have somewhat
arbitrarily assigned this letter to the first half of 1099. If Raymond
was directed to hand Laodicea over, he must have possessed it. Therefore,
so the argument seems to run, the Guinemer episode should be
accepted as explaining how Raymond came into possession of Laodicea.
But, as has already been pointed out, this explanation involves
a serious chronological inconsistency. Further, the evidence
is not conclusive that the letter ever existed—it rests upon the sole
statement of Anna Comnena—and, if it did exist, it may with more
reason, and with less violence to Anna’s chronology, be assigned to the
period between September 1099 and June 1100, when Raymond is
known to have been in possession of Laodicea and on terms of close
understanding with the Emperor.<a name="FNanchor_1043" id="FNanchor_1043"></a><a href="#Footnote_1043" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>The foregoing considerations are not, it may be conceded, sufficient
to prove that there is no shadow of truth in the tale of Guinemer and
the pirates; but they do constitute a strong case against the narrative
as it stands, and suggest the probability that it is one of the strange
pieces of fiction occasionally to be met with in the pages of Albert of
Aix.</p>

<p>Having now somewhat cleared the ground, it is possible to set forth
the probable course of events at Laodicea on the basis of the more
reliable sources.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt that Laodicea had already been taken from
the Turks when the crusaders arrived at Antioch, 21 October 1097;<a name="FNanchor_1044" id="FNanchor_1044"></a><a href="#Footnote_1044" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
and we may accept without question the statement of Raymond of
Aguilers—which Riant and Chalandon appear to ignore without
reason—that it was taken by the English, who had come by sea, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
who held it during the siege of Antioch and assisted the land forces by
protecting commerce and keeping communications open with Cyprus
and the other islands. These English mariners were unquestionably
acting in coöperation with the Emperor,<a name="FNanchor_1045" id="FNanchor_1045"></a><a href="#Footnote_1045" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> who at this time, as Chalandon
has shown, was supporting the crusaders in accordance with his
treaty obligations.<a name="FNanchor_1046" id="FNanchor_1046"></a><a href="#Footnote_1046" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>At some time during the siege of Antioch by the Christians Robert
Curthose was called to Laodicea by the English—probably because of
dangers on the landward side which made their situation there precarious—and
he remained there for a time, in the enjoyment of ease
and plenty, until he was obliged by repeated summonses and by a
threat of ecclesiastical censure to return to Antioch.<a name="FNanchor_1047" id="FNanchor_1047"></a><a href="#Footnote_1047" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> The date of
Robert’s sojourn at Laodicea cannot be determined with certainty,
but it may probably be assigned to December-January 1097-98,<a name="FNanchor_1048" id="FNanchor_1048"></a><a href="#Footnote_1048" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
8 February being the extreme limit for his return to the siege.<a name="FNanchor_1049" id="FNanchor_1049"></a><a href="#Footnote_1049" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Yet
there is no record of his presence at Antioch between 9 February and
the beginning of June, or between the end of June and 11 September;
and the possibility of his having paid more than one visit to Laodicea
must be recognized. The accounts of Ralph of Caen and of Ordericus
Vitalis, interpreted strictly, point to sojourns in the spring and in the
summer of 1098; but the chronology of these authors is not trustworthy,
and it is not unlikely that they have fallen into inaccuracies
here, and that they really refer to Robert’s earlier sojourn at Laodicea,
for which we have the indirect but more reliable evidence of Raymond
of Aguilers.</p>

<p>The arrangements which were made at Laodicea upon Robert’s
final departure before his advance to Jerusalem must remain a matter
of doubt. According to Ordericus Vitalis and Guibert of Nogent he
left a garrison, which was later driven out by the citizens. Guibert
is curiously circumstantial. He says that the citizens, unable to bear
the duke’s excessive exactions, drove his men from the citadel, threw
off his domination, and abjured the use of the money of Rouen. But
this incident is confirmed by none of the early writers who were in the
East; and in the absence of any other evidence of Robert’s having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
attempted to secure for himself a private possession in Syria, we may
well wonder whether Guibert and Ordericus have not blundered
through a misunderstanding of the actual situation in the East and
of the spirit in which Robert undertook the Crusade.</p>

<p>Finally, what is to be said of the statement of Cafaro of Genoa that,
at the time of the capture of Antioch by the crusaders, Laodicea was
under the rule of Eumathios Philocales, duke of Cyprus? It would
not be surprising if Cafaro, writing long after the event, should be
mistaken on a point of this kind; yet he is by no means to be ignored,
and on the whole his account does not seem inconsistent with established
facts. The sojourn of Robert Curthose at Laodicea was apparently
a passing episode rather than a lasting occupation. But
throughout the period under consideration the Syrian port was clearly
in the hands of crusaders, mainly English mariners, who were acting
in coöperation with the Greeks. Under existing treaty obligations the
place might fairly be regarded as a Greek possession from the moment
the Turks were expelled<a name="FNanchor_1050" id="FNanchor_1050"></a><a href="#Footnote_1050" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>—unless there were a Bohemond or some
other like-minded chief to seize and hold it in defiance of imperial
rights. And the Emperor would most naturally delegate authority
over Laodicea to the head of his administration in Cyprus. From the
Greek standpoint, therefore, it might well be regarded as subject to
Eumathios Philocales, though actually held by the Emperor’s allies,
the crusaders.</p>

<p>Between the departure of the crusaders from northern Syria early
in 1099 and their return in September after the capture of Jerusalem,
Laodicea seems to have become definitely a Greek possession; but
whether there was any violent expulsion of the garrison of a crusading
chief, as Ordericus and Guibert suppose, or any formal transfer,<a name="FNanchor_1051" id="FNanchor_1051"></a><a href="#Footnote_1051" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
must remain uncertain. When the crusaders moved southward from
northern Syria to Jerusalem, their influence at Laodicea must, it
seems, inevitably have declined, while that of the Greeks increased;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
and without any formal transfer it is conceivable that the place might
gradually and almost imperceptibly have passed under full Greek
control.</p>

<p>But for this later period there are some further scattered notices in
the chronicles of Albert of Aix and of Raymond of Aguilers and in the
anonymous <i>Gesta Francorum</i>, which must now be considered, and
which make it clear that at this time Laodicea was still in Christian
hands and served as a most important base for the further prosecution
of the Crusade.</p>

<p>Albert of Aix, who is the fullest and most specific, explains that the
crusaders still remaining in Syria gathered in council at Antioch on
2 February 1099, and, determining upon an advance to Jerusalem,
fixed 1 March as the date for a general rendezvous of all the forces at
Laodicea, a city which was then under Christian dominion.<a name="FNanchor_1052" id="FNanchor_1052"></a><a href="#Footnote_1052" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Pursuant
to this decision, Godfrey, Robert of Flanders, and Bohemond
assembled their forces at Laodicea on the appointed day. And from
Laodicea Godfrey and Robert moved on southward to the siege of
Jebeleh; but Bohemond, ever suspicious and anxious lest through
some fraud he should lose a city which was ‘impregnable by human
strength,’ returned to Antioch.<a name="FNanchor_1053" id="FNanchor_1053"></a><a href="#Footnote_1053" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> This very specific account of Albert
of Aix is confirmed by the much briefer statements of the <i>Gesta
Francorum</i>, which record the meeting of the leaders at Laodicea, the
advance of Godfrey and the count of Flanders to the siege of Jebeleh,
and the return of Bohemond to Antioch.<a name="FNanchor_1054" id="FNanchor_1054"></a><a href="#Footnote_1054" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> It is also clear from Raymond
of Aguilers that in the spring and summer of 1099—at least
until June—the port of Laodicea was open to the ships of the Greeks,
Venetians, and Genoese who were engaged in provisioning the crusaders
at Arka and at Jerusalem.<a name="FNanchor_1055" id="FNanchor_1055"></a><a href="#Footnote_1055" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>There can be little doubt, therefore, that until June 1099, Laodicea
was held in the interest of the crusaders, and that its harbor was open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
to the ships of Greeks and Italians without distinction. Albert of Aix
nowhere explains what he means when he says that Laodicea was
“under Christian dominion”; but, in the absence of valid evidence
of its retention by any of the crusading chiefs, or by the fleet of any
Italian city, the most reasonable hypothesis appears to be that it was
held by the Greeks in the interest of the common enterprise.</p>

<p>We get our next information concerning Laodicea when, in September
1099, Robert Curthose, Robert of Flanders, and Raymond of
Toulouse, upon their return from Jerusalem, found the place undergoing
a prolonged siege at the hands of Bohemond, who was assisted
in his nefarious enterprise by a fleet of Pisans and Genoese.<a name="FNanchor_1056" id="FNanchor_1056"></a><a href="#Footnote_1056" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> Since
the early summer, when ships of Genoese, Venetians, and Greeks had
all enjoyed free entry to the port, a complete change had come over
the situation at Laodicea.<a name="FNanchor_1057" id="FNanchor_1057"></a><a href="#Footnote_1057" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> What had happened to produce this?
As is well known, it was the fixed policy of the Emperor to turn the
Crusade to his own advantage, and to utilize the efforts of the Franks
for the recovery of the lost provinces which had formerly belonged to
the Greek Empire in Asia. To this end, he had been on the whole successful
in coöperating with the crusaders. But in Bohemond of Taranto
he had encountered opposition from the beginning; and, since
the capture of Antioch by the crusaders, it had been the little disguised
policy of this crafty and ambitious leader to hold it for himself,
and to make it the capital and centre around which he hoped to build
up a Norman state in Syria. It was, of course, inevitable that the
Emperor should set himself to thwart such plans by every means at
his disposal; and when the departure of the main body of the crusaders
for Jerusalem left Bohemond with a free hand in the north, open hostilities
became imminent. Undoubtedly foreseeing what was to come,
Bohemond had separated from Godfrey and Robert of Flanders at
Laodicea in March, and had returned to Antioch to mature his plans.<a name="FNanchor_1058" id="FNanchor_1058"></a><a href="#Footnote_1058" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
A few weeks later, ambassadors from the Emperor arrived in the
crusaders’ camp at Arka and lodged a complaint against Bohemond.<a name="FNanchor_1059" id="FNanchor_1059"></a><a href="#Footnote_1059" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
But the Emperor was in no position to take vigorous measures at
that time. Such a course might even have endangered his friendly
relations with the other leaders. But neither was Bohemond in a
position to resort to an overt act against Laodicea so long as he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
powerless to meet the imperial fleet at sea. In the late summer of
1099, however, all this was changed by the arrival of a Pisan fleet
under the command of Dagobert, archbishop of Pisa; for Bohemond,
with true Norman adaptability and shrewdness, came to an understanding
with the Pisans and secured their aid for an attack upon
Laodicea.<a name="FNanchor_1060" id="FNanchor_1060"></a><a href="#Footnote_1060" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> And with this, the slight naval supremacy which the
Greek Emperor had been vainly striving to maintain in the eastern
Mediterranean came to an end.<a name="FNanchor_1061" id="FNanchor_1061"></a><a href="#Footnote_1061" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>Such was the situation at Laodicea when in September 1099 Robert
Curthose and the counts of Flanders and Toulouse arrived at Jebeleh
on their way home from the Crusade. The siege had already been going
on for some time and was making progress. The place seemed to
be on the point of falling.<a name="FNanchor_1062" id="FNanchor_1062"></a><a href="#Footnote_1062" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> But never were the plans of Bohemond to
end in more egregious failure. His unprovoked attack upon a friendly
city which had rendered important services to the crusaders roused
the indignation and jealousy of the returning leaders. The archbishop
of Pisa suddenly discovered that he had been led into a false
position by the crafty Norman, and, deserting Bohemond, he threw
his powerful influence on the side of Raymond, Robert Curthose, and
Robert of Flanders. The Greeks too, who, though hard pressed, were
still holding out, well understood that Bohemond was their real enemy
and that it behooved them to make terms quickly with the leaders who
had kept faith with the Emperor. Accordingly, an agreement was
promptly reached among the Pisans, the Laodiceans, and the returning
leaders. An ultimatum was despatched to Bohemond demanding that
he withdraw forthwith; and thus suddenly confronted with superior
force, he had no choice but to yield. Wrathfully he retired under the
cover of darkness; and next morning Robert Curthose and the counts
of Flanders and Toulouse entered Laodicea with their forces, and were
enthusiastically welcomed by the inhabitants.<a name="FNanchor_1063" id="FNanchor_1063"></a><a href="#Footnote_1063" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>Count Raymond placed a strong garrison in the citadel, and raising
his banner over the highest tower, took possession of the city<a name="FNanchor_1064" id="FNanchor_1064"></a><a href="#Footnote_1064" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>—in
the Emperor’s name, it may be supposed, since by this time he clearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
had an understanding with Alexius.<a name="FNanchor_1065" id="FNanchor_1065"></a><a href="#Footnote_1065" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> A few days later he met Bohemond
outside the city and concluded peace.<a name="FNanchor_1066" id="FNanchor_1066"></a><a href="#Footnote_1066" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>After a fortnight’s sojourn at Laodicea the two Roberts and a large
number of humbler crusaders took ship and proceeded on their homeward
way. But Raymond, still suspicious of the prince of Antioch,
remained to keep a close guard upon Laodicea and Tortosa until the
following summer, when he went to Constantinople and entered the
Emperor’s service.<a name="FNanchor_1067" id="FNanchor_1067"></a><a href="#Footnote_1067" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

but, as has been pointed out above, his account is hardly trustworthy. There is a
statement in Raymond of Aguilers to the effect that during the siege of Arka (spring
of 1099) Count Raymond sent Hugh de Monteil to Laodicea to fetch the cross of
the late Bishop Adhemar: “Misit itaque comes Guillelmum Ugonem de Montilio,
fratrem episcopi Podiensis, Laodiciam, ubi crux dimissa fuerat cum capella ipsius
episcopi.” <i>H. C. Oc.</i>, iii, p. 287. It is possible that this indicates some closer Provençal
connection with Laodicea at this period than I have allowed.</p>

to turn back northward and put in at Tortosa and Laodicea; in the latter, recording

<span class="smaller">THE BATTLE OF TINCHEBRAY<a name="FNanchor_1068" id="FNanchor_1068"></a><a href="#Footnote_1068" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></span></h3>

<p>The tactics of the battle of Tinchebray have been the subject of much
discussion among recent writers, including the specialists in military
history. There is general agreement as to the strategical stroke by
which the victory was won, viz., a surprise attack upon the flank of
the ducal forces by a band of mounted knights from Maine and Brittany.
But as to the disposition of the troops in the two main armies,
widely different views are held upon two points.</p>

<p>(1) Oman thinks that the battle formation on each side was an extended
line made up of a right, centre, and left.<a name="FNanchor_1069" id="FNanchor_1069"></a><a href="#Footnote_1069" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Ramsay, on the other
hand, holds that the opposing forces were “marshalled in column, in
successive divisions”;<a name="FNanchor_1070" id="FNanchor_1070"></a><a href="#Footnote_1070" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and this view is accepted by Drummond,<a name="FNanchor_1071" id="FNanchor_1071"></a><a href="#Footnote_1071" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
by Delbrück,<a name="FNanchor_1072" id="FNanchor_1072"></a><a href="#Footnote_1072" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and by Davis,<a name="FNanchor_1073" id="FNanchor_1073"></a><a href="#Footnote_1073" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> the two latter conjecturing a formation
in échelon. Ramsay’s view is pretty clearly supported by the sources.
Ordericus Vitalis (iv, p. 229) designates a first, second, and third <i>acies</i>,
or division, on the side of the king, and a first and last (<i>extrema</i>) <i>acies</i>
on the side of the duke; and, according to his account, only the first
<i>acies</i>, i.e., the leading elements, of the two opposing forces engaged in
the fighting. The contemporary letter of a priest of Fécamp, which
is discussed below, is also specific with regard to the royal forces, describing
a first and a second <i>acies</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1074" id="FNanchor_1074"></a><a href="#Footnote_1074" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>(2) The larger question in debate between the specialists, however,
turns upon the relative importance of cavalry and infantry in the
battle of Tinchebray. Oman, relying upon a very specific passage in
Henry of Huntingdon (p. 235), and placing a strained interpretation
upon Ordericus Vitalis (iv, p. 229), holds that the battle was almost
wholly an affair of infantry, and therefore almost without precedent
in the tactics of the period.<a name="FNanchor_1075" id="FNanchor_1075"></a><a href="#Footnote_1075" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> For Ramsay, on the other hand, it was
mainly an engagement of cavalry, the foot soldiers playing but a
minor part.<a name="FNanchor_1076" id="FNanchor_1076"></a><a href="#Footnote_1076" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Drummond has gone even further and taken great pains
to demonstrate that it was a “ganze normale Schlacht des XII.
Jahrhunderts,” i.e., a battle between mounted knights, the foot soldiery
that happened to be present being held entirely in reserve;<a name="FNanchor_1077" id="FNanchor_1077"></a><a href="#Footnote_1077" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
and Drummond’s conclusions have been accepted without question by
Delbrück.<a name="FNanchor_1078" id="FNanchor_1078"></a><a href="#Footnote_1078" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>It is surprising that in none of the discussion above noted has any
account been taken of the most important extant source for the tactics
of Tinchebray, viz., a letter from a priest of Fécamp to a priest of Séez
written a very few days after the engagement, and describing with
exactness certain tactical features of the battle. If not actually by
an eyewitness, the letter is still by one who was in touch with the king
and who was well informed as to the disposition of the royal forces.
It is, therefore, entitled to rank as an authority above any of the accounts
in the chronicles. It was first discovered by Paul Meyer in
an Oxford manuscript,<a name="FNanchor_1079" id="FNanchor_1079"></a><a href="#Footnote_1079" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and published in 1872 by Léopold Delisle as
a note in his great edition of the chronicle of Robert of Torigny (i, p.
129). But, strangely overlooked by all the military historians, it remained
unused, and was rediscovered by H. W. C. Davis and published
with extensive comment in 1909 in the <i>English Historical Review</i>
(xxiv, pp. 728-732) as a “new source.” As afterwards turned
out, Davis’s transcription of the letter had been exceedingly faulty—rendering,
indeed, a part of the text which was fundamental for tactics
quite unintelligible—and in a later number of the <i>Review</i> (xxv, p. 296)
it was again published in a corrected text. By a comparison with the
original edition of Delisle<a name="FNanchor_1080" id="FNanchor_1080"></a><a href="#Footnote_1080" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> it appears that, by an almost unbelievable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
coincidence, the same omission of an entire line of the manuscript
was made there as in the edition of Davis. Yet all transcripts have
been made from a single manuscript, viz., Jesus College, Oxford, no.
51, fol. 104. We have, then, at last, a correct edition of this important
source in the <i>English Historical Review</i>, xxv, p. 296.<a name="FNanchor_1081" id="FNanchor_1081"></a><a href="#Footnote_1081" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>Davis, in commenting on the tactics of the battle in the light
of this letter, but from his own faulty transcript, maintains that
neither of the extreme views is correct, and suggests “a third interpretation
of the evidence, midway between the two existing theories.”<a name="FNanchor_1082" id="FNanchor_1082"></a><a href="#Footnote_1082" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
He holds that infantry played an important part in the action, but
still assigns much prominence to the cavalry. Apropos of the corrected
text of the priest’s letter, however, he remarks: “Taking the omitted
words into consideration, it is clear that the foot soldiers played a
larger part in the battle than I allowed in my article. The second of
Henry’s divisions, like the first, was composite, containing both infantry
and cavalry.”<a name="FNanchor_1083" id="FNanchor_1083"></a><a href="#Footnote_1083" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> This, indeed, is the correct view. Our conception
of the battle of Tinchebray must be based upon the sources, and
not upon a preconceived theory of the all-importance of the mounted
knight in twelfth-century warfare. Drummond and Delbrück have
quite unjustifiably ignored Henry of Huntingdon in favor of Ordericus
Vitalis. Whatever the theorists may hold, foot soldiers did play an unusually
large part in the battle of Tinchebray. In view of the explicit
statement of Henry of Huntingdon (p. 235) and of the priest of
Fécamp<a name="FNanchor_1084" id="FNanchor_1084"></a><a href="#Footnote_1084" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> it cannot be denied that, on the king’s side at least, some
knights were dismounted and fought on foot, in order that they might
stand more firmly (<i>ut constantius pugnarent</i>). On the other hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
Oman, while perfectly justified in pointing out the unusual prominence
given to foot soldiers, certainly exaggerates in representing the
battle as almost wholly an affair of infantry. The large part played by
cavalry is clear both from the explicit statement of the priest of
Fécamp and from the account of Ordericus Vitalis. The battle of
Tinchebray may, therefore, still claim to stand as an important precedent
in the development of mediaeval tactics because of the unusual
combination of infantry and cavalry in the fighting line.</p>

indicating the line omitted from the editions of Davis and Delisle: “In prima acie
fuerunt Baiocenses, Abrincatini, et Constantinienses, omnes pedites; <i>in secunda
vero rex cum innumeris baronibus suis, omnes similiter pedites</i>. Ad hec septingenti
equites utrique aciei ordinati; preterea comes Cenomannis et comes Britonum
Alanus Fergandus circumcingentes exercitum, usque ad mille equites, remotis
omnibus gildonibus et servis, nam totus exercitus regis prope modum ad xl milia
hominum estimabatur. Comes vero ad vi milia habuit, equites septingentos, et vix
una hora prelium stetit, Roberto de Belismo statim terga vertente, ex cuius fuga
dispersi sunt omnes.” Evidently the error in transcription was due to the fact that
the omitted clause ended in the same word as that immediately preceding it. Davis
also wrote <i>horum</i> for <i>hominum</i> in the last word but one of the following sentence.
Delisle’s edition has this correctly.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE ROBERT MEDALLION IN SUGER’S STAINED GLASS
WINDOW AT SAINT-DENIS</span></h3>

<p>A recent writer has described Suger’s reconstruction of the abbey
church of Saint-Denis as “le fait capital de l’histoire artistique du
XIIᵉ siècle”;<a name="FNanchor_1085" id="FNanchor_1085"></a><a href="#Footnote_1085" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and certainly among the most remarkable features of
that great achievement were the stained glass windows, which were
the abbot’s pride, and which he caused to be wrought “by the skilful
hands of many masters from divers nations.”<a name="FNanchor_1086" id="FNanchor_1086"></a><a href="#Footnote_1086" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The oldest painted
windows of known date which survived from the Middle Ages,<a name="FNanchor_1087" id="FNanchor_1087"></a><a href="#Footnote_1087" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> most
of them were destroyed during the French Revolution; and there
would be no occasion to mention them in connection with the life of
Robert Curthose, were it not that a series of ten medallions from one
window, representing scenes from the First Crusade, has been preserved
for us by the venerable Benedictine, Bernard de Montfaucon,
in copperplate engravings of the early eighteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_1088" id="FNanchor_1088"></a><a href="#Footnote_1088" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
eighth scene in the series has given rise to much discussion. It portrays
a Christian knight in the act of unhorsing a pagan warrior with
a mighty thrust of his lance, and bears the inscription: <span class="smcap">R DVX NORMANNORVM
PARTVM PROSTERNIT</span>.<a name="FNanchor_1089" id="FNanchor_1089"></a><a href="#Footnote_1089" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Clearly we have here some spectacular
victory of Robert Curthose over a Saracen; and it is the oldest
graphic representation of the duke now extant. The only problem
is to identify it either with a historic or with a legendary exploit
of Robert on the Crusade. Ferdinand de Mély, assuming that it had
nothing to do with veritable history, has supposed that it represented
Robert’s legendary combat with the emir ‘Red Lion’ during the
great battle of the Franks against Kerboga, as related in the <i>Chanson
d’Antioche</i>;<a name="FNanchor_1090" id="FNanchor_1090"></a><a href="#Footnote_1090" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and at Riant’s suggestion he has gone further and proposed
that it may offer a <i>terminus ad quem</i> for determining the date
of composition of that poem.<a name="FNanchor_1091" id="FNanchor_1091"></a><a href="#Footnote_1091" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Gaston Paris has very properly rejected
both these hypotheses. But he still holds that the Robert medallion
can only be explained by reference to the <i>Chanson d’Antioche</i>,
and he identifies the scene portrayed with Robert’s legendary victory
over Kerboga himself rather than with that over Red Lion.<a name="FNanchor_1092" id="FNanchor_1092"></a><a href="#Footnote_1092" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> On the
other hand, Hagenmeyer, who is better qualified to speak upon such
matters, sees not legend at all but sober history in the scene in question.
Indeed, upon comparison of the whole series of Montfaucon’s
engravings with the original narratives of the First Crusade, he finds
all the scenes portrayed to be in remarkably close agreement with
historic facts. “L’artiste qui a fait ces peintures,” he says, “a été,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
sans aucun doute, très au courant des événements marquants de la
première croisade… A proprement parler, aucune de ces peintures
ne contient d’épisode légendaire.” And the scene in the Robert
medallion he considers to be no more than a pictorial rendering of a
text from the <i>Gesta Francorum</i> describing the battle of Ascalon:
“Comes autem de Nortmannia cernens ammiravisi stantarum …
ruit vehementer super illum, eumque vulneravit usque ad mortem.”<a name="FNanchor_1093" id="FNanchor_1093"></a><a href="#Footnote_1093" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Although Mély in quoting Hagenmeyer’s opinion does not accept
it,<a name="FNanchor_1094" id="FNanchor_1094"></a><a href="#Footnote_1094" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> there can be little doubt of its correctness. The scenes from the
Crusade in Suger’s window do not, it is true, agree in every minute
detail with the primary literary sources, but the deviations are certainly
not greater than should be expected from a mediaeval painter
striving to produce an artistic result within the limitations of his
craft. The arrangement and numbering of Montfaucon’s engravings
leave some doubt as to the original sequence of the medallions, but so
far as it is possible to determine, the outstanding events of the Crusade
from the siege of Nicaea to the battle of Ascalon appear to have been
portrayed in chronological order. About the first six scenes, as arranged
by Montfaucon, there can be practically no doubt. And the
great battle against Kerboga is set in its proper place between the
capture of Antioch and the storming of Jerusalem; and there is no
indication that Robert played a special part in it, any more than there
is in the strictly historical literary sources.</p>

<p>The last four medallions as given by Montfaucon present peculiar
difficulties; and it will be well to describe them briefly, preserving his
numbering.</p>

<p>No. 7. The flight of defeated horsemen through a gate into a walled
city. Inscription: <span class="smcapuc">ARABES VICTI IN ASCALON FVGIVNT</span>.</p>

<p>No. 8. The Robert medallion which has been described above.</p>

<p>No. 9. A single combat between a Christian and a pagan horseman,
each supported by a band of warriors who fill the background.
Inscription: <span class="smcapuc">DVELLVM PARTI EX ROTBERTI FLANDRENSIS COMITIS</span>.</p>

<p>No. 10. A general combat between Christian and pagan warriors
fighting on horseback. Inscription: <span class="smcapuc">BELLVM AMITE ASCALONIA IV</span>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
and an unfilled space at the end seems to indicate that it is incomplete.
Evidently this inscription has become corrupt in transmission, and as
it stands it is not wholly intelligible. It seems clear enough, however,
that we have here a representation of the great battle of the Franks
against the Egyptian emir Malik el-Afdhal near Ascalon.</p>

<p>Now if the four medallions in question be taken in the order in
which they have just been described, it is difficult, if not impossible,
to reconcile them with the literary sources as a representation of actual
events in chronological order. But it is very doubtful whether Montfaucon
has placed them in their proper sequence. We have no way
of checking him as to the arrangement of nos. 8 and 9; but a glance at
his engravings reveals the fact that nos. 7 and 10 are not perfectly
circular like the rest, but are considerably cut away, the former in the
upper right hand sector and the latter in the upper left hand sector.<a name="FNanchor_1095" id="FNanchor_1095"></a><a href="#Footnote_1095" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
Clearly they were placed side by side at the top of the window in the
restricted space beneath the pointed arch, no. 10 being on the left
and no. 7 on the right. Now the general sequence of the medallions in
the window appears to have been from the bottom to the top; and
in that case nos. 10 and 7 must have been the last two of the series.
If this arrangement be accepted the interpretation of the last four
medallions does not seem to offer greater difficulties than that of the
first six. All four have to do with events centring around Ascalon
and the great contest of the Franks with the Egyptian emir. Nos.
8 and 9 portray the individual feats of arms of Robert Curthose and
Robert of Flanders as set forth in the literary sources.<a name="FNanchor_1096" id="FNanchor_1096"></a><a href="#Footnote_1096" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> No. 10 (with
the corrupt inscription) probably represents the general engagement in
which the exploits of the two Roberts were such notable features. And
no. 7, properly belonging at the end, represents the flight of the vanquished
pagans through the gate within the protecting walls of Ascalon.
It is true that our best literary sources in describing the pursuit
which followed the battle make no mention of this particular feature.
But we know that the inhabitants of Ascalon closed their gates and
successfully bid defiance to the crusaders;<a name="FNanchor_1097" id="FNanchor_1097"></a><a href="#Footnote_1097" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and it certainly does
not seem improbable that some of the fugitive Saracens should have
escaped thither. At any rate, the artist might very well have assumed
that they so escaped.</p>

furent mis en place de 1140 à 1144.” Michel, <i>Histoire de l’art</i>, i, p. 784. Nevertheless
it may be doubted whether all the windows were actually completed at the
time of the consecration of the choir and the translation of the relics, 11 June 1144.
The windows, only fragments of which have escaped destruction, are most fully
described by Ferdinand de Lasteyrie, <i>Histoire de la peinture sur verre d’après ses
monuments en France</i> (Paris, 1853-57), i, pp. 27-37; ii, planches iii-vii.</p>

between pages 390 and 397. Montfaucon says (p. 384): “Cette première croisade
est representée en dix tableaux sur les vitres de l’église de S. Denis, à l’extrêmité du
rond-pont derrière le grand autel, dans cette partie qu’on appelle le chevet. Ces
tableaux qu’on voit tous sur une même vitre, furent faits par ordre de l’abbé Suger,
qui s’est fait peindre plusieurs fois dans ces vitres du chevet avec son nom <i>Sugerius
Abbas</i>.” There seems no reason to doubt Montfaucon’s identification of this window
with one of those executed at Suger’s order, and modern writers have accepted
it without question. It ought to be noted, however, that no fragment of this particular
window appears to have escaped destruction, and that Suger, although he
describes two of the windows in detail and names a third, makes no specific mention
whatever of this one. And, moreover, it is the very windows which he does
describe which have in part been preserved. But on the other hand, Suger makes no
pretence at a complete list or description of the windows; and he himself indicates
that there were many. <i>Oeuvres de Suger</i>, pp. 204-206; Lasteyrie, <i>Histoire de la

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
